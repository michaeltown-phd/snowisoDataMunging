   abstract = {Direct measurements of snow accumulation at stakes near the South Pole over a 6-year period (1958-1963) provide an unusual opportunity to check the reliability of accumulation and annual-layer determinations by stratigraphic and isotopic methods. The results are gratifying. Agreement between interpretations based on stratigraphic and isotopic data is excellent, and both are consistent with accumulation-stake measurements in nearly all respects. All three procedures indicate an average annual accumulation of 7 cm of water at the South Pole over the 1958-1963 interval. Isotope data suggest that depth-hoar formation may result in relative enrichment in O •s. This could come about through partial recondensa[ion of vapor generated within the depth-hoar layer accompanied by escape of residual vapor impoverished in O •s. InSroducSion. Repeated observations on network of 36 accumulation stakes established by Giovinetto on January 27, 1958, near the South Pole station provide a means of checking other methods of determining accumulation. On December 23, 1963, nearly 6 years after the stakes were set, Gow dug pits alongside stakes 25 and 29, studied the firn stratigraphy, and collected samples for oxygen-and hydrogen-isotope study continuously to depths of 119 and 128 cm, respectively. These stakes are 1200 m apart and 2 to 3 km to windward (grid NE) of the South Pole station. The 101 samples collected were analyzed at California Institute of Technology. Since interest in rates of accumula• tion on the Antarctic ice sheet and in various techniques for determining it is currently at high level, these data are published promptly• although the completed study will include other Antarctic sites. Through reference to accumulation stake observations, Gow [1965] has demonstrated the reliability of his stratigraphic termination of annual firn layers at the South Pole. The isotopic methods give results which are in excellent agreement., although based on wholly independent variable. Publication 1298, Division of Geological Sciences , California Institute of Technology. In an earlier paper [Epstein ei al., 1963, pp. 712-714] the methods, uncertainties, and difiq-culties of identification of annual layers in Antarctic firn were discussed. Other authors have elaborated on this subject [Gonfianiini eS al., 1963; Lorius, 1964, p. 217-219; GiovineSSo, 1964, p. 137]. Initial isotope data suggested that annual accumulation at the South Pole might be as high as 15 cm of water, although it was recognized [EpsSein eS al., 1963, p. 706] that the results from one 80-cm pit, even though possibly correct, could not give an average value of great reliability because of large year-to-year variation in accumulation (Table 1). Recent tabulations [Crozaz eS a[., 1964, p. 2603; Pic-cioSSo eS a[., 1964, p. 393] of annual accumulation rates at the South Pole, as determined by accumulation-stake measurements, stratigraphy, artificial radioactive fallout, and Pb •ø, show a range from 6 to 7.5 cm of water, and 7 cm of water now seems to be the most widely accepted round figure for average accumulation at the South Pole. Thus, as pointed out by Crozaz eS a[. [1964, p. 2603], PiccioSio eS a[. [1964, p. 394], and GiovineSSo [1964, p. 137-138], the 15-cm figure is misleading. The oxygen-and hydrogen-isotope data reported herein from two sites indicate an average annual accumulation for the 6-year interval, 1809},

   abstract = {Recent advances in laser spectroscopy enable high-frequency in situ measurements of the isotope composition of water vapour. At low water vapour mixing ratios, however, the measured stable water isotope composition can be substantially affected by a measurement artefact known as the mixing ratio dependency, which is commonly considered independent of the isotope composition. Here we systematically investigate how the mixing ratio dependency, in a range from 500 to 23 000 ppmv of three commercial cavity ring-down spectrometers, is affected by the isotope composition of water vapour. We find that the isotope composition of water vapour has a substantial and systematic impact on the mixing ratio dependency for all three analysers, particularly at mixing ratios below 4000 ppmv. This isotope composition dependency can create a deviation of ±0:5 and ±6:0 for δ18O and δD, respectively, at ~ 2000 ppmv, resulting in about 2 3 deviation for the d-excess. An assessment of the robustness of our findings shows that the overall behaviour is reproducible over up to 2 years for different dry gas supplies, while being independent of the method for generating the water vapour and being the first order of the evaluation sequence. We propose replacing the univariate mixing ratio dependency corrections with a new, combined isotope composition mixing ratio dependency correction. Using aircraft- and ship-based measurements in an Arctic environment, we illustrate a relevant application of the correction. Based on our findings, we suggest that the dependency on the isotope composition may be primarily related to spectroscopy. Repeatedly characterising the combined isotope composition mixing ratio dependency of laser spectrometers when performing water vapour measurements at high elevations, on aircraft, or in polar regions appears critical to enable reliable data interpretation in dry environments.},

This paper presents a new data set of vertical column densities of H2O and HDO retrieved from short-wave infrared (2.3 μ m) reflectance measurements by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. TROPOMI features daily global coverage with a spatial resolution of up to 7km × 7km. The retrieval utilises a profile-scaling approach. The forward model neglects scattering, and strict cloud filtering is therefore necessary. For validation, recent ground-based water vapour isotopologue measurements by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are employed. A comparison of TCCON dD with ground-based measurements by the Multi-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water (MUSICA) project for data prior to 2014 (where MUSICA data are available) shows a bias in TCCON dD estimates. As TCCON HDO is currently not validated, an overall correction of recent TCCON HDO data is derived based on this finding. The agreement between the corrected TCCON measurements and co-located TROPOMI observations is good with an average bias of (-0.2 ± 3) × 1021 molec cm-2 (1.1 ± 7:2) %) in H2O and (-2±7)×1017 molec cm-2 ((-1.1±7.3/%) in HDO, which corresponds to a mean bias of (-14 ± 17) ‰ in a posteriori dD. The bias is lower at low-and mid-latitude stations and higher at high-latitude stations. The use of the data set is demonstrated with a case study of a blocking anticyclone in northwestern Europe in July 2018 using single-overpass data.},

The importance of deuterium excess signals arising from ocean sources versus signals arising from air mass modification during transport over the continents is reviewed and relevant theoretical development is presented.

Using excess parameters (combining D,17O, and 18O fractions) allow the identification of this alteration caused by sublimation and condensation of surface hoar.

High-resolution isotope profiles from snow pits dug in 1989, 1990, and 1991 near the Greenland Ice Sheet Project II (GISP2) site reveal that stable isotope ratios (15•80 and fiD) preserve this distinctive temperature cycle. This indicates that snow accumulation occurs frequently through the year at the Greenland Summit and that the isotope record initially contains temperature information from many times of the year. Through an empirically derived emissivity model using AWS air temperature data and satellite microwave brightness temperatures, our approach allows isotope values preserved in the snow to be related to estimated near-surface air temperatures. Density-corrected profiles allow the amounts and timing of accumulation to be determined as well. Our results indicate that stable isotope ratios from the near-surface snow at the Greenlan d Summit are currently a reliable, high-resolution temperature proxy. This result increases confidence in the paleoclimatic interpretation of isotope signal variations in the GISP2 and Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) deep ice cores.},

A steady state regime is assumed for the evaporation of water at the ocean surface and the subsequent formation of precipitation. The calculations show that the deuterium and oxygen 18 content in precipitation can be taken as linearly related. From the slope and the intercept (known as the deuterium excess) of the deltaD-delta18O linear relationship for precipitation we compute the mean values on a global scale of the evaporating ocean surface temperature and the relative humidity of the air masses overlying the oceans. The deuterium excess is primarily dependent on the mean relative humidity of the air masses formed above the ocean surface. Paleoclimatic data may be obtained by this isotopic method from the analysis of old water and ice samples. A moisture deficit of the air over the ocean, equal to only 10%, in comparison to 20% for modern conditions, is deduced from the deuterium-oxygen 18 distribution measured in groundwater samples older than 20,000 years.- Authors Centre d'Etudes Nucleaires/Saclay, Boite Postale 2, 91190,, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.},

Here we use the diffusion model of Whillans and Grootes [1985] to calculate the effects of isotopic diffusion in nine shallow ice cores recovered over a 150 × 150 km grid centered on Summit, Greenland. Two different computational methods give similar results for the back-diffused δ18O seasonal extrema. Although back diffusing the ice core δ18O records improves the correlations between the individual ice core oxygen isotope and Greenland coastal temperature records; the correlations remain poor, particularly for the low-accumulation sites. Stacking the back-diffused isotopic records from several cores results in much higher correlations, with a strong winter linkage between west coast stations and central Greenland. These correlations are also significantly greater than the correlations between the stacked measured (diffused) isotopic profiles and coastal temperatures.

It is unlikely that the trend in the core from Taylor Mouth (the flank site) is due to a standard d 18 O-surface temperature relationship. Assuming that the Taylor Dome (near-summit) core records local climate variations common to both cores, we assess two leading possible causes for the observed differences: (1) Relative to Taylor Dome, Taylor Mouth may collect snow from more sources with distinct isotopic compositions. (2) Vapor motion during prolonged near-surface exposure may cause post-depositional isotope enrichment at Taylor Mouth, where the accumulation rate is low. Our model of firn pore-space vapor and sublimating ice grains suggests that post-depositional processes can modify d 18 O values by several %.

Theoretical studies have suggested that the variability of the parameter 17O excess resulting from the triple isotopic composition of oxygen in water should be driven by the relative humidity of the oceanic source region. Our new 17O excess measurements in surface water vapor and snow at the Greenland NEEM camp demonstrate the potential of 17O excess as a marker of source relative humidity. Using concomitant measurements of water vapor and precipitation, we first confirm the theoretical relationship between the fractionation coefficients at vapor-solid equilibrium α 17eq_vap_sol and α 18eq_vap_sol associated respectively with δ 17O and δ 18O: ln(α 17eq_vap_sol)/ln(α 18eq_vap_sol)=0.528. Our data reveal 17O excess seasonal variations in Greenland firn over the years 2003-2005. Their magnitude is of the order of 25ppm, with a minimum in July leading d-excess maximum level reached ~3months later. This is in agreement with our understanding of 17O excess and d-excess variations in polar regions with minima in 17O exces in phase with maxima in source relative humidity and maxima in d-excess largely influenced by source temperature increase. In a large northern Atlantic sector, relative humidity reaches its seasonal maximum in summer, earlier than the sea surface temperature maximum which takes place in fall. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Quantifying the magnitude of post-depositional processes affecting the isotopic composition of surface snow is essential for a more accurate interpretation of ice core data. To achieve this, high temporal resolution measurements of both lower atmospheric water vapor and surface snow isotopic composition are required. This study presents continuous measurements of water vapor isotopes performed in East Antarctica (Kohnen station) from December 2013 to January 2014 using a laser spectrometer. Observations have been compared with the outputs of two atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) equipped with water vapor isotopes: ECHAM5-wiso and LMDZ5Aiso. During our monitoring period, the signals in the 2m air temperature T, humidity mixing ratio q and both water vapor isotopes δD and δ18O are dominated by the presence of diurnal cycles. Both AGCMs simulate similar diurnal cycles with a mean amplitude 30 to 70% lower than observed, possibly due to an incorrect simulation of the surface energy balance and the boundary layer dynamics. In parallel, snow surface samples were collected each hour over 35h, with a sampling depth of 2-5 mm. A diurnal cycle in the isotopic composition of the snow surface is observed in phase with the water vapor, reaching a peak-to-peak amplitude of 3‰ for δD over 24 h (compared to 36 ‰ for δD in the water vapor). A simple box model treated as a closed system has been developed to study the exchange of water molecules between an air and a snow reservoir. In the vapor, the box model simulations show too much isotopic depletion compared to the observations. Mixing with other sources (advection, free troposphere) has to be included in order to fit the observations. At the snow surface, the simulated isotopic values are close to the observations with a snow reservoir of ∼5 mm depth (range of the snow sample depth). Our analysis suggests that fractionation occurs during sublimation and that vapor-snow exchanges can no longer be considered insignificant for the isotopic composition of near-surface snow in polar regions.},

   abstract = {Water stable isotopes in Greenland ice core data provide key paleoclimatic information, and have been compared with precipitation isotopic composition simulated by isotopically enabled atmospheric models. However, post-depositional processes linked with snow metamorphism remain poorly documented. For this purpose, monitoring of the isotopic composition (δ18O, δD) of near-surface water vapor, precipitation and samples of the top (0.5 cm) snow surface has been conducted during two summers (2011-2012) at NEEM, NW Greenland. The samples also include a subset of 17O-excess measurements over 4 days, and the measurements span the 2012 Greenland heat wave. Our observations are consistent with calculations assuming isotopic equilibrium between surface snow and water vapor. We observe a strong correlation between near-surface vapor δ18O and air temperature (0.85 ± 0.11‰ °C-1 (R = 0.76) for 2012). The correlation with air temperature is not observed in precipitation data or surface snow data. Deuterium excess (d-excess) is strongly anti-correlated with δ18O with a stronger slope for vapor than for precipitation and snow surface data. During nine 1-5-day periods between precipitation events, our data demonstrate parallel changes of δ18O and d-excess in surface snow and near-surface vapor. The changes in δ18O of the vapor are similar or larger than those of the snow δ18O. It is estimated using the CROCUS snow model that 6 to 20% of the surface snow mass is exchanged with the atmosphere. In our data, the sign of surface snow isotopic changes is not related to the sign or magnitude of sublimation or deposition. Comparisons with atmospheric models show that day-to-day variations in near-surface vapor isotopic composition are driven by synoptic variations and changes in air mass trajectories and distillation histories. We suggest that, in between precipitation events, changes in the surface snow isotopic composition are driven by these changes in near-surface vapor isotopic composition. This is consistent with an estimated 60% mass turnover of surface snow per day driven by snow recrystallization processes under NEEM summer surface snow temperature gradients. Our findings have implications for ice core data interpretation and model-data comparisons, and call for further process studies. © Author(s) 2014.},

The upper boundary condition is skin-surface temperature derived from routine upwelling longwave radiation measurements, while the lower boundary condition is set to the seasonal temperature gradient at 6.5 m depth, taken from prior measurements at the South Pole. We focus on statistics of temperature, heat fluxes, heating rates and vapour pressures in the top metre of snow, but present results from the full depth of the model (6.5 m). The monthly mean net heat flux into the snow agrees with results from previous studies performed at the South Pole. On shorter timescales, the heating rates and vapour pressures show large variability. The net heat flux into the snow, which is between ±5 W m −2 in the monthly mean, can be greater than ±20 W m −2 on hourly timescales. On sub-daily timescales, heating rates exceed 40 K d −1 in the top 10 cm of the snow. Subsurface temperatures, and therefore heating rates, are more variable during winter (April-September) due to increased synoptic activity and the presence of a strong, surface-based, atmospheric temperature inversion. The largest vapour pressures (60-70 Pa) and vertical gradients of vapour pressure are found in the top metre of snow during the short summer (December-January). In contrast, during the long winter, the low temperatures result in very small vapour pressures and insignificant vapour-pressure gradients. The high summertime vapour-pressure gradients may be important in altering the isotopic composition of snow and ice on the Antarctic plateau.},

   abstract = {A Rayleigh fractionation model is developed to investigate postdepositional modification of stable isotopes of water in the near-surface snow of East Antarctica. The processes of forced ventilation, pore-space diffusion, and intra-ice-grain diffusion are parameterized through characteristic time constants. Routine meteorological observations, their derived products, and general glaciological conditions from the South Pole are used to simulate the δ<sup>18</sup>O of near-surface snow as it evolves in time. The sensitivity of δ<sup>18</sup>O of near-surface snow to wind speed, surface temperature, and accumulation rate is tested through model experiments. A steady wind of 5-10 m s<sup>-1</sup> results in annual mean δ<sup>18</sup>O enrichment of 3-7‰. Enrichment of the heavy isotope occurs predominantly in buried winter snow layers during summer. However, in many simulations, there is a slight depletion of δ<sup>18</sup>O summer layers that occurs as atmospheric water vapor is deposited within the snow during winter. Postdepositional modification of water stable isotopes in near-surface snow also depends on the snow accumulation rate; high accumulation rates quickly advect snow layers away from the influence of the atmosphere, preventing significant modification. Low accumulation rates (e.g., at Vostok and Dome C) allow significant postdepositional modification because the near-surface snow is exposed to forced ventilation for several annual cycles. Postdepositional modification during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at Summit, Greenland is estimated to be greater than the present-day postdepositional modification. Therefore the temperature difference for LGM may be larger than that previously inferred from the δ<sup>18</sup>O record. However, because of the compensating effects of lower temperatures and smaller accumulation during the LGM in Antarctica, the postdepositional enrichment in East Antarctica may be approximately the same for LGM as for the modern climate.

   abstract = {I n chapter 2 the isotopic fractionation of water in some simple condensation-evaporation processes are considered quantitatively on the basis of the fractionation factors given in section 1.2. The condensation temperature is an important parameter, which has got some glaciological applications. The temperature effect (the 6's decreasing with temperature) together with varying evaporation and exchange appear in the "amount effect" as high 6's in sparse rain. The relative deuterium-oxygen-18 fractio-nation is not quite simple. If the relative deviations from the standard water (S.M.O.W.) are called 6, and 6,,, the best linear approximation is 6, = 8 6,,. Chapter 3 gives some qualitative considerations on non-equilibrium (fast) processes. Kinetic effects have heavy bearings upon the effective fractionation factors. Such effects have only been demonstrated clearly in evaporation processes, hut may also influence condensation processes. The quantity d = 6,-8 is used as an index for non-equilibrium conditions. The stable isotope data from the world wide 1.A.E.A.-W.M.O. precipitation survey are discussed in chapter 4. The unweighted mean annual composition of rain at tropical island stations fits the line 6, = 4.6 6,, indicating a first stage equilibrium condensation from vapour evaporated in a non-equilibrium process. Regional characteristics appear in the weighted means. The Northern hemisphere continental stations, except African and Near East, f i t the line 6 , = 8.0 a,, + 10 as far as the weighted means are concerned (6, = 8.1 a, , + 11 for the unweighted) corresponding to an equilibrium Rayleigh condensation from vapour, evaporated in a non-equilibrium process from S.M.O.W. The departure from equilibrium vapour seems even higher in the rest of the investigated part of the world. At most stations the 6, and varies linearily with a, , with a slope close to 8, only at two stations higher than 8, at several lower than 8 (mainly connected with relatively dry climates). Considerable variations in the isotopic composition of monthly precipitation occur at most stations. At low latitudes the amount effect accounts for the variations, whereas seasonal variation at high latitudes is ascribed to the temperature effect. Tokyo is an example of a mid latitude station influenced by both effects. Some possible hydrological applications are outlined in chapter 5.},

   abstract = {Water stable isotopes in central Antarctic ice cores are critical to quantify past temperature changes. Accurate temperature reconstructions require one to understand the processes controlling surface snow isotopic composition. Isotopic fractionation processes occurring in the atmosphere and controlling snowfall isotopic composition are well understood theoretically and implemented in atmospheric models. However, post-deposition processes are poorly documented and understood. To quantitatively interpret the isotopic composition of water archived in ice cores, it is thus essential to study the continuum between surface water vapour, precipitation, surface snow and buried snow. Here, we target the isotopic composition of water vapour at Concordia Station, where the oldest EPICA Dome C ice cores have been retrieved. While snowfall and surface snow sampling is routinely performed, accurate measurements of surface water vapour are challenging in such cold and dry conditions. New developments in infrared spectroscopy enable now the measurement of isotopic composition in water vapour traces. Two infrared spectrometers have been deployed at Concordia, allowing continuous, in situ measurements for 1 month in December 2014-January 2015. Comparison of the results from infrared spectroscopy with laboratory measurements of discrete samples trapped using cryogenic sampling validates the relevance of the method to measure isotopic composition in dry conditions. We observe very large diurnal cycles in isotopic composition well correlated with temperature diurnal cycles. Identification of different behaviours of isotopic composition in the water vapour associated with turbulent or stratified regime indicates a strong impact of meteorological processes in local vapour/snow interaction. Even if the vapour isotopic composition seems to be, at least part of the time, at equilibrium with the local snow, the slope of δD against δ18O prevents us from identifying a unique origin leading to this isotopic composition.},

   abstract = {The isotopic signal (δ18O and dD) imprinted in ice cores from Antarctica is not solely generated by the temperature sensitivity of the isotopic composition of precipitation, but it also contains the signature of the intermittency of the precipitation patterns, as well as of post-deposition processes occurring at the surface and in the firn. This leads to a proxy signal recorded by the ice cores that may not be representative of the local climate variations. Due to precipitation intermittency, the ice cores only record brief snapshots of the climatic conditions, resulting in aliasing of the climatic signal and thus a large amount of noise which reduces the minimum temporal resolution at which a meaningful signal can be retrieved. The analyses are further complicated by isotopic diffusion, which acts as a low-pass filter that dampens any high-frequency changes. Here, we use reanalysis data (ERAInterim) combined with satellite products of accumulation to evaluate the spatial distribution of the numerical estimates of the transfer function that describes the formation of the isotopic signal across Antarctica. As a result, the minimum timescales at which the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds unity range from less than 1 year at the coast to about 1000 years further inland. Based on solely physical processes, we are thus able to define a lower bound for the timescales at which climate variability can be reconstructed from the isotopic composition in ice cores.},

We review modeling approaches for each proxy class, and pair them with an isotope-enabled climate simulation to illustrate the new scientific insights that may be gained from this framework. Applications include parameter sensitivity analysis, the quantification of archive-specific processes on the recorded climate signal, and the quantification of how chronological uncertainties affect signal detection, demonstrating the utility of PRYSM for a broad array of climate studies.},

   abstract = {Analyzing seasonally resolved δ18O ice core data can aid the interpretation of the climate information in ice cores, also providing insights into factors governing the δ18O signal that cannot be deciphered by investigating the annual δ18O data only. However, the seasonal isotope signal has not yet been investigated in northern Greenland, e.g., at the NEEM (North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling) ice core drill site. Here, we analyze seasonally resolved δ18O data from four shallow NEEM ice cores covering the last 150 years. Based on correlation analysis with observed temperature, we attribute about 70 and 30%of annual accumulation to summer and winter, respectively. The NEEM summer δ18O signal correlates strongly with summer western Greenland coastal temperature and with the first principal component (PC1) of summer δ18O from multiple seasonally resolved ice cores from central/southern Greenland. However, there are no significant correlations between NEEM winter δ18O data and western Greenland coastal winter temperature or southern/central Greenland winter δ18O PC1. The stronger correlation with temperature during summer and the dominance of summer precipitation skew the annual δ18O signal in NEEM. The strong footprint of temperature in NEEM summer δ18O record also suggests that the summer δ18O record rather than the winter δ18O record is a better temperature proxy at the NEEM site. Despite the dominant signal of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in the central?southern ice core data, both NAO and AMO exert weak influences on NEEM seasonal δ18O variations. The NEEM seasonal δ18O is found to be highly correlated with Baffin Bay sea ice concentration (SIC) in the satellite observation period (1979?2004), suggesting a connection of the sea ice extent with δ18O at NEEM. NEEM winter δ18O significantly correlates with SIC even for the period prior to satellite observation (1901? 1978). The NEEM winter δ18O may reflect sea ice variationsof Baffin Bay rather than temperature itself. This study shows that seasonally resolved δ18O records, especially for sites with a seasonal precipitation bias such as NEEM, provide a better understanding of how changing air temperature and circulation patterns are associated with the variability in the δ18O records.},

Used in combination, oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios also provide information on sea surface temperature at the oceanic moisture source locations where polar precipitation originates. Temperature reconstructions obtained from ice core records generally rely on linear approximations of the relationships among local temperature, source temperature and water-isotope values. However, there are important nonlinearities that significantly affect such reconstructions, particularly for source-region temperatures. 5 Here, we describe a temperature reconstruction method that accounts for these nonlinearities. We provide new reconstructions of absolute surface temperature, condensation temperature, and source-region evaporation temperature for all long Antarctic ice-core records for which the necessary data are available. We also provide thorough uncertainty estimates on all temperature histories. Our reconstructions constrain the pattern and magnitude of polar amplification in the past and reveal asymmetries in the temperature histories of East and West Antarctica.},

   abstract = {Stable isotope ratios δ18O and δD in polar ice provide a wealth of information about past climate evolution. Snow-pit studies allow us to relate observed weather and climate conditions to the measured isotope variations in the snow. They therefore offer the possibility to test our understanding of how isotope signals are formed and stored in firn and ice. As δ18O and δD in the snowfall are strongly correlated to air temperature, isotopes in the near-surface snow are thought to record the seasonal cycle at a given site. Accordingly, the number of seasonal cycles observed over a given depth should depend on the accumulation rate of snow. However, snow-pit studies from different accumulation conditions in East Antarctica reported similar isotopic variability and comparable apparent cycles in the δ18O and δD profiles with typical wavelengths of ∼ 20cm. These observations are unexpected as the accumulation rates strongly differ between the sites, ranging from 20 to 80mmĝ€†w. e. ĝ€†yr-1 ( ∼ 6-21cm of snow per year). Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the isotopic variations individually at each site; however, none of these are consistent with the similarity of the different profiles independent of the local accumulation conditions.Here, we systematically analyse the properties and origins of δ18O and δD variations in high-resolution firn profiles from eight East Antarctic sites. First, we confirm the suggested cycle length (mean distance between peaks) of ∼ 20cm by counting the isotopic maxima. Spectral analysis further shows a strong similarity between the sites but indicates no dominant periodic features. Furthermore, the apparent cycle length increases with depth for most East Antarctic sites, which is inconsistent with burial and compression of a regular seasonal cycle. We show that these results can be explained by isotopic diffusion acting on a noise-dominated isotope signal. The firn diffusion length is rather stable across the Antarctic Plateau and thus leads to similar power spectral densities of the isotopic variations. This in turn implies a similar distance between isotopic maxima in the firn profiles.Our results explain a large set of observations discussed in the literature, providing a simple explanation for the interpretation of apparent cycles in shallow isotope records, without invoking complex mechanisms. Finally, the results underline previous suggestions that isotope signals in single ice cores from low-accumulation regions have a small signal-to-noise ratio and thus likely do not allow the reconstruction of interannual to decadal climate variations.},

The characterization of the stable water isotopologue flux between the surface and the atmosphere offers the potential to constrain parameterizations of these physical surface exchange processes in numerical models. In addition, observations of isotopologue surface fluxes allow the evaluation of surface fluxes as a process influencing the formation of the climate signal retrieved from ice core isotopologue records. Here, we present a record of stable water isotopologue surface fluxes measured in-situ in the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet at the East Greenland Ice Core Project site. We measured isotopologue fluxes above the snow surface directly by combining high-frequency eddy covariance measurements with low-frequency isotopologue measurements from a cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS). We developed a method to correct for the high-frequency loss of the CRDS by combining humidity measurements from both the CRDS and eddy covariance instruments. Using this approach our measurements provide the first direct observations of water isotopologue fluxes in polar areas. We observed a clear diurnal cycle in the fluxes of the different water isotopologues. The isotopic composition of the sublimation and deposition flux showed to be dependent on the snow and vapor isotopic composition, respectively. To a first order, the isotopic composition of the sublimation flux could be derived assuming equilibrium fractionation during sublimation.},

   abstract = {Ice cores from polar ice sheets and glaciers are an important climate archive. Snow layers, consecutively deposited and buried, contain climatic information from the time of their formation. However, particularly low-Accumulation areas are characterised by temporally intermittent precipitation, which can be further redistributed after initial deposition, depending on the local surface features at different spatial scales. Therefore, the accumulation conditions at an ice core site influence the quantity and quality of the recorded climate signal in proxy records. This study aims to characterise the local accumulation patterns and the evolution of the snow height to describe the contribution of the snow (re-)deposition to the overall noise level in climate records from ice cores. To this end, we applied a structure-from-motion photogrammetry approach to generate near-daily elevation models of the surface snow for a 195g€¯m2 area in the vicinity of the deep drilling site of the East Greenland Ice-core Project in northeast Greenland. Based on the snow height information we derive snow height changes on a day-To-day basis throughout our observation period from May to August 2018 and find an average snow height increase of g1/4g€¯11g€¯cm. The spatial and temporal data set also allows an investigation of snow deposition versus depositional modifications. We observe irregular snow deposition and erosion causing uneven snow accumulation patterns, a removal of more than 60g€¯% of the deposited snow, and a negative relationship between the initial snow height and the amount of accumulated snow. Furthermore, the surface roughness decreased by approximately a factor of 2 throughout the spring and summer season at our study site. Finally, our study shows that structure from motion is a relatively simple method to demonstrate the potential influences of depositional processes on proxy signals in snow and ice.},

For near-calm weak winds and strong stratification, the turbulence can be difficult to isolate from wave-like motions and more complex small-scale structures. The smallest scale perturbations on time-scales less than 5 s behave most like turbulence. Larger-scale perturbations are characterized by very weak vertical velocity fluctuations and large temperature fluctuations, but lead to systematic downward heat flux after extensive averaging. For near-calm nocturnal conditions, significant turbulence is mainly generated by short-term (minutes) accelerations of unknown origin. The turbulence between such infrequent mixing events is extremely weak, but not zero. While the turbulence in the events approximately follows similarity theory, the extremely weak turbulence scales neither with stratification nor bulk shear, and its inferred vertical length-scale is small compared to the distance from the ground, even at the 2 m level. © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Supersaturation with respect to ice determines the strength of nonequilibrium fractionation during vapor deposition onto ice or snow and therefore influences the water isotopic composition of vapor and precipitation in cold environments. Historically, most general circulation models formed clouds through saturation adjustment and therefore prevented supersaturation. To match the observed isotopic content, especially the deuterium excess, of snow in polar regions, the saturation ratio with respect to ice (Si) was parameterized, usually by assuming a linear dependence of Si on temperature. The Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 (CAM5) no longer applies saturation adjustment for the ice phase and thus allows ice supersaturation. Here, we adapt the isotope-enabled version of CAM5 to compute nonequilibrium fractionation in ice and mixed-phase clouds based on Si from the CAM5 microphysics and use it to evaluate the common parameterization of Si. Our results show a wide range of Si predicted by the CAM5 microphysics and reflected in the simulated deuterium excess of Antarctic precipitation; this is overly simplified by the linear parameterization. Nevertheless, a linear function, when properly tuned, can reproduce the average observed relationship between δD and deuterium excess reasonably well. However, only the model-predicted Si can capture changes in microphysical conditions under different climate states that are not due to changes in temperature. Furthermore, parametric sensitivity tests show that with the model-predicted Si, water isotopes are more closely tied to the model microphysics and can therefore constrain uncertain microphysical parameters.},

The seasonal cycles of monthly mean net radiation and turbulent heat fluxes are approximately equal, with a difference of 40 W m<sup>2</sup> between summer and winter, while the seasonal cycle of subsurface heat fluxes is only a few W m<sup>2</sup>, For an 8-month period (the winter of 2001), we calculate two estimates of turbulent heat fluxes, one from Monin-Obukhov (MO) similarity theory and one as the residual of the surface energy budget (i.e., subsurface heat fluxes minus net radiation, where all fluxes toward the snow surface are positive). The turbulent fluxes from MO theory agree well with the residual of the energy budget under lapse conditions. However, under stable conditions MO theory underestimates turbulent fluxes by approximately 40-60%. The relationship between turbulent heat fluxes as a residual of the energy budget, temperature inversion strength, and wind shear as a function of the bulk Richardson number (Ri<inf>b</inf>) is examined under stable conditions (i.e., positive Ri<inf>b</inf>). The Ri <inf>b</inf> used here is calculated from 10-m wind speeds and 0- to 2-m temperature inversion strength. No critical value of Ri<inf>b</inf>is found where the turbulent heat fluxes drop to zero. However, a threshold (Ri <inf>b</inf> = 0.05) exists below which 70% of the turbulent energy fluxes can be explained by only the temperature inversion strength. For Ri<inf>b</inf> 0.05, the relationship between turbulent heat fluxes and temperature inversion strength decreases, while the importance of wind shear to turbulent heat transfer increases. Above Ri<inf>b</inf>= 0.05, a growing linear correlation also exists between atmospheric temperature inversion strength and wind shear. Thus, inversion strength and wind shear are not independent predictors of turbulent heat flux for extremely stable conditions. The exact values of the correlation coefficients and Ri<inf>b</inf> threshold are likely specific to the experimental conditions; however, their implications are probably valid for all stable flows.

During February 2017 and 2018 we carried out two major field campaigns over the sea ice of the northern Baltic Sea, close to the Finnish island of Hailuoto at 65°N. In total 14 intensive observational periods (IOPs) resulted in extensive SBL datasets with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, which will form the basis for various numerical modeling experiments. First results from the campaigns indicate numerous very stable boundary layer (VSBL) cases, characterized by strong stratification, weak winds, and clear skies, and give detailed insight in the temporal evolution and vertical structure of the entire SBL. The SBL is subject to rapid changes in its vertical structure, responding to a variety of different processes. In particular, we study cases involving a shear instability associated with a low-level jet, a rapid strong cooling event observed a few meters above ground, and a strong wave-breaking event that triggers intensive near-surface turbulence. Furthermore, we use observations from one IOP to validate three different atmospheric models. The unique finescale observations resulting from the ISOBAR observational approach will aid future research activities, focusing on a better understanding of the SBL and its implementation in numerical models.},

   abstract = {We explore the potential of a new method for the estimation of profiles of turbulence statistics in the stable boundary layer (SBL). By applying gradient-based scaling to multicopter unoccupied aircraft system (UAS) profiles of temperature and wind, sampled over sea-ice during the 2018 Innovative Strategies for Observations in the Arctic Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ISOBAR18) field campaign, turbulence profiles can be derived. We first validate this method by scaling turbulence observations from three levels on a 10-m mast with the corresponding scaling parameters, and compare the resulting non-dimensional parameters to the semi-empirical similarity functions proposed for this scaling scheme. The scaled data of turbulent fluxes and variances from the three levels collapse to their corresponding similarity functions. After the successful validation, we estimate turbulence statistics from UAS profiles by computing profiles of the gradient Richardson number to which we then apply the similarity functions. These UAS profiles are processed from raw time-series data by applying low-pass filters, time-response corrections, altitude corrections, and temporal averaging across successive flights. We present three case studies covering a broad range of SBL conditions to demonstrate the validity of this approach. Comparisons against turbulence statistics from the 10-m mast and a sodar indicate the broad agreement and physically meaningful results of the method. Successful implementation of the method thus offers a powerful diagnostic tool that requires only a multicopter UAS with a simple thermodynamic sensor payload.},

   abstract = {The response of radiosondes to an instantaneous change of environment was studied by taking the instruments from a warm building into the cold environment at South Pole Station. After being initialized inside, the radiosondes were carried outside and placed on the snow surface, where they were left until they reported stable values of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity. Three models of radiosondes were tested: Vaisala RS80, Atmospheric Instrumentation Research (AIR) 4A, and AIR 5A. The reported temperature equilibrated to the outside conditions within 30 s. However, it frequently took 30 min before the relative humidity outside was accurately reported. Additionally, the reported pressure rose by several hectopascals over a 5-min period when the sonde was taken outside. In the RS80s this bias was as large as 10 hPa, and disappeared in about 30 min. In the AIR sondes, the maximum pressure bias was never much over 2 hPa, but seemed not to diminish with time. The RS80s were also tested to see if, once equilibrated to the outside conditions, they could respond to smaller changes that would be encountered in flight. The results in this case indicate that, with some corrections for time lag, the RS80 can provide accurate data at low temperatures if allowed to equilibrate initially. The results of these tests together indicate that the quality of upper-air data in cold regions could be improved if radiosondes are stored and prepared at ambient temperature or are given at least 30 min to equilibrate outside after being prepared inside.},

   abstract = {Six levels of meteorological sensors have been deployed along a 45 m tower at the French-Italian Concordia station, Dome C, Antarctic. We present measurements of vertical profiles, the diurnal cycle, and interdiurnal variability of temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction for 3 weeks during the southern summer of 2008. These measurements are compared to 6-hourly European Center for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses and daily radiosoundings. The ECMWF analyses show a 3-4°C warm bias relative to the tower observations. They reproduce the diurnal cycle of temperature with slightly weaker amplitude and weaker vertical gradients. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle of relative humidity is overestimated by ECMWF because the amplitude of the absolute humidity diurnal cycle is too small. The nighttime surface-based wind shear and Ekman spiral is also not reproduced in the ECMWF analyses. Radiosonde temperatures are biased low relative to the tower observations in the lowest 30 m but approach agreement at the top of the tower. Prior to bias correction for age-related contamination, radiosonde relative humidities are biased low relative to the tower observations in the lowest 10 m but agree with tower observations above this height. After correction for the age-related bias, the radiosonde relative humidity agrees with tower observations below 10 m but is biased high above this height. Tower temperature observations may also be biased by solar heating, despite radiation shielding and natural ventilation. Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {Data from radiosondes, towers, and a thermistor string are used to characterize the temperature inversion at two stations: the Amundsen-Scott Station at the South Pole, and the somewhat higher and colder Dome C Station at a lower latitude. Ten years of temperature data from a 22-m tower at the South Pole are analyzed. The data include 2-and 22-m temperatures for the entire period and 13-m temperatures for the last 2 yr. Statistics of the individual temperatures and the differences among the three levels are presented for summer (December and Janu-ary) and winter (April-September). The relationships of temperature and inversion strength in the lowest 22 m with wind speed and downward longwave flux are examined for the winter months. Two preferred regimes, one warming and one cooling, are found in the temperature versus longwave flux data, but the physical causes of these regimes have not been determined. The minimum temperatures and the maximum inversions tend to occur not with calm winds, but with winds of 3-5 m s 1 , likely due to the inversion wind. This inversion wind also explains why the near-surface winds at South Pole blow almost exclusively from the northeast quadrant. Temperature data from the surface to 2 m above the surface from South Pole in the winter of 2001 are presented, showing that the steepest temperature gradient in the entire atmosphere is in the lowest 20 cm. The median difference between the temperatures at 2 m and the surface is over 1.0 K in winter; under clear skies this difference increases to about 1.3 K. Monthly mean temperature profiles of the lowest 30 km of the atmosphere over South Pole are presented, based on 10 yr of radiosonde data. These profiles show large variations in lower-stratospheric temperatures, and in the strength and depth of the surface-based inversion. The near-destruction of a strong inversion at South Pole during 7 h on 8 September 1992 is examined using a thermal-conductivity model of the snowpack, driven by the measured downward longwave flux. The downward flux increased when a cloud moved over the station, and it seems that this increase in radiation alone can explain the magnitude and timing of the warming near the surface. Temperature data from the 2003/04 and 2004/05 summers at Dome C Station are presented to show the effects of the diurnal cycle of solar elevation over the Antarctic Plateau. These data include surface temperature and 2-and 30-m air temperatures, as well as radiosonde air temperatures. They show that strong inversions, averaging 10 K between the surface and 30 m, develop quickly at night when the sun is low in the sky, but are destroyed during the middle of the day. The diurnal temperature range at the surface was 13 K, but only 3 K at 30 m.},

This paper provides a brief overview of the meteorological conditions and establishes that the study period was moderately drier and warmer than the climatological mean. The paper also identifies and chemically characterizes the major air mass types influencing the site. Meteorological analyses and back trajectories establish that air mass origin oscillated between relatively clean Canadian regions (except for periods influenced by Canadian forest fires) and regions of greater anthropogenic emissions in the contiguous United States. Higher mixing ratios of ozone, CO, NOx and NOz were generally associated with southerly transport, which occurred 24% of the time. Lower mixing ratios were observed under northerly transport, which occurred 44% of the time. The dominance of northerly transport was due to a stronger than normal Hudson Bay low. The remaining 32% of the time was occupied by transitional periods between distinct air masses. A positive slope exists between ozone and CO when photochemically aged air masses are selected. However, no meaningful relationship between ozone and CO was observed when northerly and southerly transport periods were considered separately. Comparison to other summertime rural locations suggests that rapid and frequent transitions between air masses of contrasting source regions play an important role in maintaining the 0.3 O3/CO slope commonly observed in eastern North America.

The process is a result of the difference in saturation vapor pressures with respect to liquid and ice, and may in some circumstances lead to abrupt and complete cloud glaciation at temperatures between -40 °C and 0 °C in the Earth's atmosphere. The process is named after three eminent scientists who were active in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, among them being German meteorologist WALTER FINDEISEN (1909-1945). In his classical paper published in 1938, FINDEISEN described the contemporary understanding of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process and other key cloud microphysical processes. Here, we compare the understanding of the aforementioned processes at the time with that of the present, and find that they are remarkably similar.

This may happen at close proximity, but as time indoors increases, infections can occur in shared room air despite distancing. We propose two indicators of infection risk for this situation, that is, relative risk parameter (Hr) and risk parameter (H). They combine the key factors that control airborne disease transmission indoors: virus-containing aerosol generation rate, breathing flow rate, masking and its quality, ventilation and aerosol-removal rates, number of occupants, and duration of exposure. COVID-19 outbreaks show a clear trend that is consistent with airborne infection and enable recommendations to minimize transmission risk. Transmission in typical prepandemic indoor spaces is highly sensitive to mitigation efforts. Previous outbreaks of measles, influenza, and tuberculosis were also assessed. Measles outbreaks occur at much lower risk parameter values than COVID-19, while tuberculosis outbreaks are observed at higher risk parameter values. Because both diseases are accepted as airborne, the fact that COVID-19 is less contagious than measles does not rule out airborne transmission. It is important that future outbreak reports include information on masking, ventilation and aerosol-removal rates, number of occupants, and duration of exposure, to investigate airborne transmission.},

However, its most common interpretation as moisture source temperature cannot directly be inferred from present-day water isotope observations. Here, we use a new empirical relation betweendand near-surface relative humidity (RH) together with reanalysis data to globally predictdof surface evaporation from the ocean. The very good quantitative agreement of the predicted hemispherically averaged seasonal cycle with observeddin precipitation indicates that moisture source relative humidity, and not sea surface temperature, is the main driver ofdvariability on seasonal timescales. Furthermore, we review arguments for an interpretation of long-term palaeoclimaticdchanges in terms of moisture source temperature, and we conclude that there remains no sufficient evidence that would justify to neglect the influence of RH on such palaeoclimaticdvariations. Hence, we suggest that either the interpretation ofdvariations in palaeorecords should be adapted to reflect climatic influences on RH during evaporation, in particular atmospheric circulation changes, or new arguments for an interpretation in terms of moisture source temperature will have to be provided based on future research. © Author(s) 2014.

   abstract = {The Greenland climate network has currently 18 automatic weather stations (AWS) distributed in most climate regions of the ice sheet. The present network captures well the regional climates and their differences in the accumulation region of the ice sheet. An annual mean latitudinal temperature gradient of -0.78°C / 1° latitude was derived from the AWS data for the western slope of the ice sheet, and an annual mean latitudinal temperature gradient of -0.82°C / 1° latitude was derived for the eastern slope. The mean annual lapse rate along the surface slope is 0.71°C / 100 m, with monthly mean lapse rates varying between 0.4°C / 100 m in summer and 1.0°C / 100 m in winter. The annual range of monthly mean temperatures is between 23.5°C and 30.3°C for the western slope of the ice sheet, with increasing ranges from south to north and with increase in elevation. The annual mean air temperature was found to be 2°C warmer for the central part of Greenland for the time period 1995-1999, as compared to the standard decade 1951-1960. This annual mean temperature change decreased to approximately 1°C for the elevation 1000-2000 m, whereas at lower elevations, no AWS data are available with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to verify any temperature trend. Firn temperatures (10-m depth) at high-elevation sites were found to be colder than the mean annual air temperature of the preceding year for the central part and northern Greenland by as much as 2.5°C. In the percolation zone and at the equilibrium line altitude the firn and ice temperatures at 10 m were consistently warmer than the annual mean air temperature because of percolation of meltwater and the isolation effect of the snow cover. The wind speed and direction are affected by the katabatic outflow of the cold air along the slope of the ice sheet, whereas at higher elevations the large-scale synoptic condition is the dominant factor that governs the wind field. The surface height change at high elevations (accumulation minus sublimation) can be approximated with a linear model over an annual cycle using AWS data, whereas in the ablation region and along the equilibrium line altitude the surface height change shows a strong annual cycle.

Unlike previous studies, the method allows for a quantitative demarcation of evaporative moisture sources. This is achieved by taking into account the temporal sequence of evaporation into and precipitation from an air parcel during transport, as well as information on its proximity to the boundary layer. The moisture source region diagnostic was applied to trace the origin of water vapor for winter precipitation over the Greenland ice sheet for 30 selected months with pronounced positive, negative, and neutral North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' ERA-40 reanalysis data. The North Atlantic and the Nordic seas proved to be the by far dominant moisture sources for Greenland. The location of the identified moisture sources in the North Atlantic basin strongly varied with the NAO phase. More specifically, the method diagnosed a shift from sources north of Iceland during NAO positive months to a maximum in the southeastern North Atlantic for NAO negative months, qualitatively consistent with changes in the concurrent large-scale mean flow. More long-range moisture transport was identified during the NAO negative phase, leading to the adveotion of moisture from more southerly locations. Different regions of the Greenland ice sheet experience differing changes in the average moisture source locations; variability was largest in the north and west of Greenland. The strong moisture source variability for Greenland winter precipitation with the NAO found here can have a large impact on the stable isotope composition of Greenland precipitation and hence can be impottant for the interpretation of stable isotope data from ice cores. In a companio paper, the implications of the present results are further explored in that respect. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Proxy-based reanalyses aim to make optimum use of both proxy and model data while presenting paleoclimate information in an accessible format-they will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in the future of paleoclimate 5 research. In the Paleoclimate Reanalysis Project (PaleoR) we use "off-line" data assimilation to constrain the CESM1 (CAM5) Last Millennial Ensemble (LME) simulation with a globally distributed multivariate proxy dataset, producing a decadal resolution reanalysis of the past millennium. Discrete time periods are "reconstructed" by using anomalous (±0.5σ) proxy climate signals to select an ensemble of climate state ana-10 logues from the LME. Prior to assimilation the LME simulates internal variability that is temporally inconsistent with information from the proxy archive. After assimilation the LME is highly correlated to almost all included proxy data, and dynamical relationships between modelled variables are preserved; thus providing a "real-world" view of climate system evolution during the past millennium. Unlike traditional regression based 15 approaches to paleoclimatology, PaleoR is unaffected by temporal variations in tele-connection patterns. Indices representing major modes of global ocean-atmosphere climate variability can be calculated directly from PaleoR spatial fields. PaleoR derived ENSO, SAM, and NAO indices are consistent with observations and published multiproxy reconstructions.

   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is altering ecological and human systems globally, including in United States (US) national parks, which conserve unique biodiversity and resources. Yet, the magnitude and spatial patterns of climate change across all the parks have been unknown. Here, in the first spatial analysis of historical and projected temperature and precipitation across all 417 US national parks, we show that climate change exposes the national park area more than the US as a whole. This occurs because extensive parts of the national park area are in the Arctic, at high elevations, or in the arid southwestern US. Between 1895 and 2010, mean annual temperature of the national park area increased 1.0 °C ± 0.2 °C century-1 (mean ± standard error), double the US rate. Temperature has increased most in Alaska and its extensive national parks. Annual precipitation of the national park area declined significantly on 12% of national park area, compared to 3% of the US. Higher temperatures due to climate change have coincided with low precipitation in the southwestern US, intensifying droughts in the region. Physical and ecological changes have been detected and attributed mainly to anthropogenic climate change in areas of significant temperature increases in US national parks. From 2000 to 2100, under the highest emissions scenario (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5), park temperatures would increase 3 °C-9 °C, with climate velocities outpacing dispersal capabilities of many plant and animal species. Even under the scenario of reduced emissions (RCP2.6), temperature increases could exceed 2 °C for 58% of national park area, compared to 22% of the US. Nevertheless, greenhouse gas emissions reductions could reduce projected temperature increases in national parks by one-half to two-thirds.},

   abstract = {In 2003-07 summer balance was measured at altitudes between 1700 and 3382 m a.s.l. on two glaciers on Mount Rainier, Washington State, USA (46.85 • N, 121.72 • W; 4400 m a.s.l.): south-facing Nisqually Glacier and east-northeast-facing Emmons Glacier. Upper-air temperatures at the nearest gridpoint in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis database are used in a distributed (over altitude) positive-degree-day (PDD) model. For each glacier the model used the same coefficients at all altitudes, for all years. The rms model error was 0.65 (r 2 = 0.87) and 0.78 m a −1 w.e. (r 2 = 0.93) for Nisqually and Emmons Glaciers, respectively. Although PDD work generally uses different coefficients for snow and ice surfaces, and the duration of exposure of those surfaces varies with altitude, error in this single-coefficient model is nearly uncorrelated with altitude. Values of coefficients obtained are within the range of those found in other PDD work. The degree-day coefficient, however, differs markedly between the two glaciers, and is shown to be controlled by the difference between them in vertical gradient of measured summer balance. It is smaller for Nisqually Glacier, where solar radiation is a stronger contributor to melt; and larger for Emmons Glacier, where it is a weaker contributor. Over 1948-2007, when the model calibrated over 2003-07 was applied to the upper-air temperatures, estimated summer balance was ∼0.4 m a −1 less negative over 1962-83 than before and ∼0.6 m a −1 less negative than after, corresponding roughly with changes of the northeast Pacific sea-surface temperatures.},

Since 1980, glaciers shrank at a rate of −0.59 km2 yr−1 during which time 35 glaciers and 16 perennial snowfields disappeared. Area changes of Blue Glacier, the largest glacier in the study region, was a good proxy for glacier change of the entire region. Modeled glacier mass balance, based on monthly air temperature and precipitation, correlates with glacier area change. The mass balance is highly sensitive to changes in air temperature rather than precipitation, typical of maritime glaciers. In addition to increasing summer melt, warmer winter temperatures changed the phase of precipitation from snow to rain, reducing snow accumulation. Changes in glacier mass balance are highly correlated with the Pacific North American index, a proxy for atmospheric circulation patterns and controls air temperatures along the Pacific Coast of North America. Regime shifts of sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific, reflected in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), trigger shifts in the trend of glacier mass balance. Negative (“cool”) phases of the PDO are associated with glacier stability or slight mass gain whereas positive (“warm”) phases are associated with mass loss and glacier retreat. Over the past century the overall retreat is due to warming air temperatures, +0.7°C in winter and +0.3°C in summer. The glaciers in the Olympic Mountains are expected to largely disappear by 2070.},

The snow is found to undergo coarsening down to approximately 2.5 m depth before grain growth and densification become the prevalent mechanisms of microstructure change. In contrast to previous assumptions, distinct anisotropy of the ice and pore geometry is observed throughout the profile, with a maximum at 2.5 m depth. The air permeability and the degree of anisotropy vary with depth and can be linked to short-term changes in accumulation rate via the residence time for which a certain snow layer stays in the uppermost 2.5 m. Patterns of the degree of anisotropy and air permeability of buried polar firn are relative indicators of past accumulation rates.},

Models disagree on how this will affect the thickness of the firn layer-the relatively low-density upper layer of the ice sheets that influences altimetric observations of ice-sheet mass change and paleo-climate reconstructions from ice cores. Here we examine how b influences firn compaction and porosity in a simplified model that accounts for mass conservation, dry firn compaction, grain size evolution, and the impact of grain size on firn compaction. Treating b as a 5 boundary condition and employing an Eulerian reference frame helps to untangle the factors controlling the b-dependence of firn thickness. We present numerical simulations using the model as well as simplified steady-state approximations to the full model, to demonstrate how the downward advection of porosity and of grain size are both affected by b, but have opposing impacts on firn thickness. The net result is that firn thickness increases with b and that the strength of this dependence increases with the surface grain size. We also quantify the circumstances under which porosity-and grain-size-advection balance exactly, 10 which counter-intuitively renders steady-state firn thickness independent of b. These findings are qualitatively independent of the stress-dependence of firn compaction and whether the thickness of the ice-sheet is increasing, decreasing, or steady. They do depend on the grain-size dependence of firn compaction. Firn models usually ignore grain-size evolution, but we highlight the complex effect it can have on firn thickness when included in a simplified model. This work motivates future efforts to better observationally constrain the rheological effect of grain size in firn.},

Throughout a year, they can cover up to 11% of the Earth surface, concentrated toward the poles. These forms impact the local surface energy balance and the distribution of precipitation. Only a few studies have concentrated on their genesis. Their size ranges from 2cm (ripple marks) to 2.5m tall (whaleback dunes). We counted a total of seven forms that are widely recognized. Among them sastrugi, an erosional shape, is the most widespread. From laser scans, we compared scaling of snow versus sand barchan morphology. We found that both have proportionally the same footprint, but snow barchans are flatter. The key difference is that snow can sinter, immobilizing the bedform and creating an erodible material. Using a model, we investigated the effect of sintering on snow dune dynamics. We found that sintering limits their size because it progressively hardens the snow and requires an ever-increasing wind speed to maintain snow transport. From the literature and results from this model, we have reclassified snow bedforms based on two parameters: wind speed and snow surface conditions. The new data show that snow dune behavior mirrors that of sand dunes, with merging, calving, and collision. However, isolated snow barchans are rare, with most of the snow surfaces encountered in the field consisting of several superimposed bedforms formed sequentially during multiple weather events. Spatially variable snow properties and geometry can explain qualitatively these widespread compound snow surfaces.},

The detailed snowpack model Crocus is such a scheme, and has been run operationally for avalanche forecasting over the French mountains for 20 yr. It is also used for climate or hydrological studies. To extend its potential applications, Crocus has been recently integrated within the framework of the externalized surface module SURFEX. SURFEX computes the exchanges of energy and mass between different types of surface and the atmosphere. It includes in particular the land surface scheme ISBA (Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere). It allows Crocus to be run either in stand-alone mode, using a time series of forcing meteorological data or in fully coupled mode (explicit or fully implicit numerics) with atmospheric models ranging from meso-scale models to general circulation models. This approach also ensures a full coupling between the snow cover and the soil beneath. Several applications of this new simulation platform are presented. They range from a 1-D stand-alone simulation (Col de Porte, France) to fully-distributed simulations in complex terrain over a whole mountain range (Massif des Grandes Rousses, France), or in coupled mode such as a surface energy balance and boundary layer simulation over the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (Dome C). © 2009 Author(s).},

We have developed the Community Firn Model (CFM), an open-source, modular model framework designed to simulate numerous physical processes in firn. The modules include firn densification, heat transport, meltwater percolation and refreezing, water isotope diffusion, and firn-air diffusion. The CFM is designed so that new modules can be added with ease. In this paper, we first describe the CFM and its modules. We then demonstrate the CFM's usefulness in two model applications that utilize two of its novel aspects. The CFM currently has the ability to run any of 13 previously published firn densification models, and in the first application we compare those models' results when they are forced with regional climate model outputs for Summit, Greenland. The results show that the models do not agree well (spread greater than 10 %) when predicting depth-integrated porosity, firn age, or the trend in surface elevation change. In the second application, we show that the CFM's coupled firn-air and firn densification models can simulate noble gas records from an ice core better than a firn-air model alone.},

   abstract = {Of critical importance for avalanche forecasting, is the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from only a handful of field observations. To that end, it is common for avalanche forecasters to not only have to rely on sparse data, but also on their own intuitive understanding of how their field-based observations may be correlated to complex physical processes responsible for structural instability within a snowpack. One such well-documented basis for mechanical instability to increase within a snowpack is that caused by the presence of a buried ice lens or ice crust. Although such icy layers are naturally formed and frequently encountered in seasonal snowpacks, very little is known about the microstructural evolution of these layers and how they contribute toward weak layer development. Furthermore, in terms of assessing the structural integrity of the snowpack, there is at the present time no consistent treatment for identifying these layers a priori as problematic or benign. To address this issue, we have created an idealized laboratory scenario in which we can study how an artificially created ice lens may affect the thermophysical and microstructural state of the interface between the ice lens and adjacent layers of snow while under a controlled temperature gradient of primarily -100Km-1. Utilizing in situ micro-thermocouple measurements, our findings show that a super-temperature gradient exists within only a millimeter of the ice lens surface that is many times greater than the imposed bulk temperature gradient. Such large temperature gradients on such a small scale would not be measurable by most field-based instrumentation and to our knowledge these laboratory-based in situ measurements are the first of their kind. Additionally, we have also investigated and characterized the microstructural evolution of the ice-snow interface with X-ray Micro-computed Tomography and Scanning Electron Microscopy. In our analysis, we have been able to identify distinct regions of simultaneous ice crystal growth, sublimation, and kinetic snow metamorphism. We hold that these observations are both consistent with previous laboratory studies and observations made in the natural environment.},

This study addressed these two areas by examining an STSP called "Students, Teachers, and Rangers and Research Scientists" (STaRRS). STaRRS was incorporated into the existing long-standing education program "Expedition: Yellowstone!" For teachers, a pre-test, intervention, post-test research design was used to assess changes and gains in content knowledge, attitudes, and pedagogical practices. A quasi-experimental, pre-test-post-test, comparison group design was used to gauge gains in students' content knowledge and attitudes. Data analyses showed significant positive shifts in teachers' attitudes regarding science and scientists, and shifts in their pedagogical choices. Students showed significant content knowledge gains and increased positive attitudes regarding their perceptions of scientists. The findings indicate that STSPs might serve as a promising context for providing teachers and students with the sort of experiences that enhance their understandings of and about scientific inquiry, and improve their attitudes toward science and scientists. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Establishing the abundance of the extinct radionuclide 60 Fe (half-life 2.62 Ma) in the early solar system is important for understanding the astrophysical context of solar system formation. While bulk measurements of early solar system phases show a low abundance consistent with galactic background, some in situ measurements by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imply a higher abundance, which would require injection from a nearby supernova (SN). Here we present in situ nickel isotopic analyses by resonance ionization mass spectrometry (RIMS) in a chondrule from the primitive meteorite Semarkona (LL3.00). The same chondrule had been previously analyzed by SIMS. Despite improved precision compared to SIMS, the RIMS nickel isotopic data do not reveal any resolved excesses of 60 Ni that could be unambiguously ascribed to in situ 60 Fe decay. Linear regression of 60 Ni/ 58 Ni versus 56 Fe/ 58 Ni yields an initial 60 Fe/ 56 Fe ratio for this chondrule of (3.8 ± 6.9) 10 -8 , which is consistent with both the low initial value found by bulk measurements and the low end of the range of initial ratios inferred from some in situ work. The same regression also gives a solar initial 60 Ni/ 58 Ni ratio, which shows that this sample was not disturbed by nickel mobilization, thus agreeing with a low initial 60 Fe/ 56 Fe ratio. These findings agree with a re-evaluation of previous SIMS measurements of the same sample. Supernova injection of 60 Fe into the solar system or its parental cloud material is therefore not necessary to account for the measured solar system's initial amount of 60 Fe.},

   abstract = {To understand the role of water vapor feedback in unperturbed surface temperature variability, a version of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory coupled ocean-atmosphere model is integrated for 1000 yr in two configurations, one with water vapor feedback and one without. For all spatial scales, the model with water vapor feedback has more low-frequency (timescale 2 yr) surface temperature variability than the one without. Thus water vapor feedback is positive in the context of the model's unperturbed variability. In addition, water vapor feedback is more effective the longer the timescale of the surface temperature anomaly and the larger its spatial scale. To understand the role of water vapor feedback in global warming, two 500-yr integrations were also performed in which CO 2 was doubled in both model configurations. The final surface global warming in the model with water vapor feedback is 3.38C, while in the one without it is only 1.05C. However, the model's water vapor feedback has a larger impact on surface warming in response to a doubling of CO 2 than it does on internally generated, low-frequency, global-mean surface temperature anomalies. Water vapor feedback's strength therefore depends on the type of temperature anomaly it affects. The authors found that the degree to which a surface temperature anomaly penetrates into the troposphere is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of its associated water vapor feedback. The more the anomaly penetrates, the stronger the feedback. It is also shown that the apparent impact of water vapor feedback is altered by other feedback mechanisms, such as albedo and cloud feedback. The sensitivity of the results to this fact is examined. Finally, the authors compare the local and global-mean surface temperature time series from both unperturbed variability experiments to the observed record. The experiment without water vapor feedback does not have enough global-scale variability to reproduce the magnitude of the variability in the observed global-mean record, whether or not one removes the warming trend observed over the past century. In contrast, the amount of variability in the experiment with water vapor feedback is comparable to that of the global-mean record, provided the observed warming trend is removed. Thus, the authors are unable to simulate the observed levels of variability without water vapor feedback.},

   abstract = {Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas, the most important gaseous source of infrared opacity in the atmosphere. As the concentrations of other greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, increase because of human activity, it is centrally important to predict how the water vapor distribution will be affected. To the extent that water vapor concentrations increase in a warmer world, the climatic effects of the other greenhouse gases will be amplified. Models of the Earth's climate indicate that this is an important positive feedback that increases the sensitivity of surface temperatures to carbon dioxide by nearly a factor of two when considered in isolation from other feedbacks, and possibly by as much as a factor of three or more when interactions with other feedbacks are considered. Critics of this consensus have attempted to provide reasons why modeling results are overestimating the strength of this feedback. Our uncertainty concerning climate sensitivity is disturbing. The range most often quoted for the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is 1.5 °C to 4.5 °C. If the Earth lies near the upper bound of this sensitivity range, climate changes in the twenty-first century will be profound. The range in sensitivity is primarily due to differing assumptions about how the Earth's cloud distribution is maintained; all the models on which these estimates are based possess strong water vapor feedback. If this feedback is, in fact, substantially weaker than predicted in current models, sensitivities in the upper half of this range would be much less likely, a conclusion that would clearly have important policy implications.

   abstract = {The Pacific Northwest is the most highly glacierized region in the conterminous United States (858 glaciers; 466 km2). These glaciers have displayed ubiquitous patterns of retreat since the 1980s mostly in response to warming air temperatures. Glacier melt provides water for downstream uses including agricultural water supply, hydroelectric power generation, and for ecological systems adapted to cold reliable streamflow. While changes in glacier area have been studied within the region over an extended period of time, the hydrologic consequences of these changes are not well defined. We applied a high-resolution glacio-hydrological model to predict glacier mass balance, glacier area, and river discharge for the period 1960–2099. Six river basins across the region were modeled to characterize the regional hydrological response to glacier change. Using these results, we generalized past and future glacier area change and discharge across the entire Pacific Northwest using a k-means cluster analysis. Results show that the rate of regional glacier recession will increase, but the runoff from glacier melt and its relative contribution to streamflow display both positive and negative trends. In high-elevation river basins enhanced glacier melt will buffer strong declines in seasonal snowpack and decreased late summer streamflow, before the glaciers become too small to support streamflow at historic levels later in the 21st century. Conversely, in lower-elevation basins, smaller snowpack and the shrinkage of small glaciers result in continued reductions in summer streamflow.},

   abstract = {Dumont d'Urville station, located on the East coast of Antarctica in Adélie Land, is in one of the windiest coastal region on Earth, due to katabatic winds downslope from the East Antarctic ice sheet. In summer, the season of interest in this study, coastal weather is characterized by well-marked diel cycles in temperature and wind patterns. Our study aims at exploring the added value of water vapor stable isotopes in coastal Adélie Land to provide new information on the local atmospheric water cycle and climate. An important application is the interpretation of water isotopic profiles in snow and ice cores recently drilled in Adélie Land. We present the first continuous measurements of δ 18 O and d-excess in water vapor over Adélie Land. During our measurements period (26/12/2016 to 03/02/2017), we observed clear diel cycles in terms of temperature, humidity and isotopic composition. The cycles in isotopic composition are particularly large given the muted variations in temperature when compared to other Antarctic sites where similar monitoring have been performed. Based on data analyses and simulations obtained with the regional MAR model on the coastal Adélie Land, we suggest that the driver for δ 18 O and d-excess diel variability in summer at Dumont d'Urville is the variation of the strength of the wind coming from the continent: the periods with strong wind are associated with the arrival of relatively dry air with water vapor associated with low δ 18 O and high d-excess from the Antarctic plateau. Finally, in addition to the interpretation of snow and ice core isotopic profiles in the coastal regions, our study has implications for the evaluation of atmospheric models equipped with water isotopes.},

   abstract = {Radiation fogs at Summit, Greenland (72.58°N, 38.48°W, 3210 masl) are frequently reported by observers. The fogs are often accompanied by fogbows, indicating the particles are composed of liquid and because of the low temperatures at Summit, this liquid is super-cooled. Here we analyse the formation of these fogs as well as their physical and radiative properties. In situ observations of particle size and droplet number concentration were made using scattering spectrometers 15 near 2 m and 10 m height from 2012 to 2014. These data are complemented by co-located observations of meteorology, turbulent and radiative fluxes, and remote sensing. We find that liquid fogs occur in all seasons with the highest frequency in September and a minimum in April. Due to the characteristics of the boundary-layer meteorology, the fogs are elevated, forming between 2 m and 10 m and the particles then fall toward the surface. The diameter of mature particles is typically 20-25 μm in summer. Number concentrations are higher at warmer temperatures and, thus, higher in summer compared to winter. 20},

   abstract = {We performed an intensive verification of an isotope-incorporated atmospheric general circulation model with vapor isotope observation data by two satellite sensors in preparation for data assimilation of water isotopes. A global IsoGSM simulation forced toward the reanalysis wind field, atmospheric total column data from SCIAMACHY on Envisat, and mid-tropospheric (800 to 500 hPa) data from TES on Aura were used. For the mean climatological δD of both the total atmospheric column and the mid-troposphere layer, the model reproduced their geographical variabilities quite well. There is, however, some degree of underestimation of the latitudinal gradient (higher δD in the tropics and lower δD in mid-latitudes) compared to the SCIAMACHY data, whereas there is an over-amplification of the longitudinal variation (higher δD in South America-Atlantic-Africa and lower δD in Maritime Continent) compared to the TES data. It was also found that the two satellite products have different relationships between water vapor amount and isotopic composition. Particularly, atmospheric column mean δD, which is dominated by lower tropospheric vapor, closely follows the fractionation pattern of a typical Rayleigh-type "rain-out" process, whereas in the mid-troposphere the relationship between isotopic composition and vapor amount is affected by a "mixing" process. This feature is not reproduced by the model, where the relationships between δD and the vapor are similar to each other for the atmospheric column and mid-troposphere. Comparing on a shorter time scale, it becomes clear that the data situation for future data assimilation for total column δD is most favorable for tropical and subtropical desert areas (i.e., Sahel, southern Africa, mid-eastern Asia, Gobi, Australia, and southwest US), whereas the available mid-tropospheric δD observations cover wider regions, particularly over tropical to subtropical oceans.},

   abstract = {The parameterization of the boundary layer is a challenge for regional climate models of the Arctic. In particular, the stable boundary layer (SBL) over Greenland, being the main driver for substantial katabatic winds over the slopes, is simulated differently by different regional climate models or using different parameterizations of the same model. However, verification data sets with high-resolution profiles of the katabatic wind are rare. In the present paper, detailed aircraft measurements of profiles in the katabatic wind and automatic weather station data during the experiment KABEG (Katabatic wind and boundary-layer front experiment around Greenland) in April and May 1997 are used for the verification of the regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM) nested in ERA-Interim reanalyses. CCLM is used in a forecast mode for the whole Arctic with 15 km resolution and is run in the standard configuration of SBL parameterization and with modified SBL parameterization. In the modified version, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production and the transfer coefficients for turbulent fluxes in the SBL are reduced, leading to higher stability of the SBL. This leads to a more realistic representation of the daily temperature cycle and of the SBL structure in terms of temperature and wind profiles for the lowest 200 m.},

The model results are intercompared and validated against observational data from automatic weather stations (AWS), global atmospheric analyses and instrumented aircraft observations of individual cases during that period. The NORLAM is able to simulate the synoptic developments and daily cycle of the katabatic wind system realistically. For most of the cases covered by aircraft observations, the model results agree very well with the measured developments and structures of the katabatic wind system in the lowest 400 m. Despite NORLAM's general ability of reproducing the four-dimensional structure of the katabatic wind, problems occur in cases, when the synoptic background is not well captured by the analyses used as initial and boundary conditions for the model runs or where NORLAM fails to correctly predict the synoptic development. The katabatic wind intensity in the stable boundary layer is underestimated by the model in cases when the simulated synoptic forcing is too weak. An additional problem becomes obvious in cases when the model simulates clouds in contrast to the observations or when the simulated clouds are too thick compared to the observed cloud cover. In these cases, the excessive cloud amount prevents development of the katabatic wind in the model.},

The simulations are performed with a modified version of The Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5), referred to as the Polar MM5. Global atmospheric analyses as well as automatic weather station and instrumented aircraft observations from Greenland are used to verify the forecast atmospheric state. The model is found to reproduce the observed atmospheric state with a high degree of realism. Monthly mean values of the near-surface temperature and wind speed predicted by the Polar MM5 differ from the observations by less than 1 K and 1 m s 1 , respectively, at most sites considered. In addition, the model is able to simulate a realistic diurnal cycle for the surface variables, as well as capturing the large-scale, synoptically forced changes in these variables. Comparisons of modeled profiles of wind speed, direction, and potential temperature in the katabatic layer with aircraft observations are also favorable, with small mean errors. The simulations of the katabatic winds are found to be sensitive to errors in the large-scale forcing (e.g., the large-scale pressure gradient) and to errors in the representation of key physical processes, such as turbulence in the very stable surface layer and cloud-radiation interaction.},

   abstract = {Using data from the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO/ANT1 the momentum budget of the Antarctic atmospheric surface layer (SL; taken as the lowest model layer located at 6-7 m above the surface) is presented. In July (winter), the katabatic pressure gradient force (PGF) dominates the SL momentum budget over the steep coastal slopes, which results in strong (10-15 m s 1) and directionally constant katabatic winds. Farther inland, where surface slopes are more gentle, the large-scale PGF may become equally important. With the circumpolar pressure trough north of the Antarctic coastline, the large-scale PGF acts along with the katabatic PGF in the downslope direction. In Wilkes Land, Dronning Maud Land, and on the western Ross Ice Shelf, the large-scale PGF causes equivalent geostrophic winds in excess of 10 m s 1. Thermal wind effects that oppose the downslope acceleration are especially strong in areas where large-scale forcing is weak, which allows cold air to pile up over the flat ice shelves and sea ice-covered ocean. In January, absorption of shortwave radiation at the surface strongly reduces the katabatic forcing and thermal wind effects, and the large-scale PGF dominates the SL momentum budget. Interestingly, large-scale easterly winds in some regions are stronger in summer than in winter, which explains the year-round constancy of Antarctic SL winds. In contrast, the large-scale SL winds in coastal West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula are very variable on the seasonal timescale.},

   abstract = {Antarctica is known for its strong and persistent surface winds that are directed along topographic pathways. Surface winds are especially strong during the winter period. The high directional constancy of the wind and the close relationship of the wind direction to the underlying terrain can be interpreted as evidence of katabatic wind activity. Observations show that the directional constancy of the Antarctic surface wind displays little seasonal variation. Summertime winds cannot be expected to contain a significant katabatic component, owing to enhanced solar heating of the ice slopes. Observations also show that the coastal environs are subjected to wide variation in atmospheric pressure associated with frequent cyclone activity. The robust unidirectional nature of the Antarctic surface wind throughout the year implies that significant topographic influences other than those from katabatic forcing must be acting. Idealized numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the potential role of the Antarctic topography in shaping the wind. The presence of katabatic winds is dependent on radiative cooling of the ice slopes. Simulations without explicit longwave radiation show that the blocking influence of the Antarctic orography is a powerful constraint to the surface wind regime. Resulting low-level wind fields resemble katabatic winds, with directions being tied to the underlying terrain and speeds dependent on the slope of the ice surface. A numerical simulation of a strong wind event during austral autumn shows that the katabatic component is only a small fraction of the horizontal pressure gradient force for this case. This suggests that the role of katabatic winds in the Antarctic boundary layer may be overemphasized and that the adjustment process between the continental ice surface and the ambient pressure field may be the primary cause of the Antarctic wind field.},

   abstract = {Observations from a novel autonomous Doppler sodar wind profiling system are described and analysed. These include the first continuous wintertime soundings of katabatic winds over Antarctica - a continent with which they are synonymous. During 2002 and 2003 over 2600 wind profiles were taken during 'case-studies' of high-resolution sounding lasting hours to days. These case-studies have been subjectively classified as: synoptically driven, katabatically influenced (28 days); primarily katabatically driven flows (a subset of 16 days); or other flow types. The Doppler sodar observations were augmented by automatic weather station observations at the field site and further up the slope, as well as synoptic and upper-air observations at Halley Research Station, some 50 km distant on the Brunt Ice Shelf. In primarily kataba tic flows there is a systematic change in the shape and depth of the low-level katabatic jet with wind speed. Relatively strong katabatic flows (maximum winds of typically 8-10 m s-1) have a jet maximum between 20 and 60 m above the surface and are relatively deep (up to 200 m); while moderate katabatic flows (4-8 m s-1) typically have a jet maximum between 3 and 30 m and are shallower (∼100 m), although they can also be more diffuse in structure with a wind speed maximum at higher altitude. In all katabatic flows there is backing of wind direction with height, consistent with decreasing friction away from the surface. During summertime katabatic flows there is a clear diurnal signature at all heights, although this is less pronounced in the surface layer where there seems to be a persistent 2-4 m s-1 katabatic flow during all case-studies. Where the diurnal forcing results in an abrupt katabatic flow deceleration, i.e. what may be a katabatic 'jump', there is a concurrent vertical acceleration. Wind profiles from a recent numerical weather prediction study of idealized katabatic flows at this site compare favourably with selected mean profiles; the only significant difference is that the model's wind speed is too low over the lowest ∼10 m. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2006.},

High-resolution isotope profiles from snow pits dug in 1989, 1990, and 1991 near the Greenland Ice Sheet Project II (GISP2) site reveal that stable isotope ratios (15•80 and fiD) preserve this distinctive temperature cycle. This indicates that snow accumulation occurs frequently through the year at the Greenland Summit and that the isotope record initially contains temperature information from many times of the year. Through an empirically derived emissivity model using AWS air temperature data and satellite microwave brightness temperatures, our approach allows isotope values preserved in the snow to be related to estimated near-surface air temperatures. Density-corrected profiles allow the amounts and timing of accumulation to be determined as well. Our results indicate that stable isotope ratios from the near-surface snow at the Greenlan d Summit are currently a reliable, high-resolution temperature proxy.

Two different computational methods give similar results for the back-diffused δ18O seasonal extrema. Although back diffusing the ice core δ18O records improves the correlations between the individual ice core oxygen isotope and Greenland coastal temperature records; the correlations remain poor, particularly for the low-accumulation sites. Stacking the back-diffused isotopic records from several cores results in much higher correlations, with a strong winter linkage between west coast stations and central Greenland. These correlations are also significantly greater than the correlations between the stacked measured (diffused) isotopic profiles and coastal temperatures.

   abstract = {`Understanding physical processes in near-zero accumulation areas can help us to better understand polar ice-core records, particularly during periods when accumulation rates were lower than today. We report measurements from a 5 m firn core from the Allan Hills, Antarctica, which include physical properties using computer tomography, stable isotope ratios δD and δ18O, and 210Pb activity. The core shows a highly metamorphosed firn with homogeneous and stable structure, but with discrete layers near the surface. The observed firn structure is caused by a combination of unique depositional and post-depositional processes. The irregular dD and d18O signal does not follow the stratigraphic sequence and implies post-depositional modification caused by microscopic pressure gradients in the firn that can result from either forced ventilation over rough surfaces in the presence of wind or alternating temperature-gradients between the firn and the atmosphere. Our results also indicate impact snow deposition under high winds and with a high initial density and air exchange between the atmosphere and the snowpack. 210Pb activity below 0.3 m falls below the detection limit, implying that most of the core is more than 100 years old. We conclude that the Allan Hills record provides a unique opportunity to investigate important processes that would have affected ice-core records from glacial periods.},

   abstract = {The δD and δ18O values of water are key measurements in polar ice-core research, owing to their strong and well-understood relationship with local temperature. Deuterium excess, d, the deviation from the average linear relationship between δD and δ18O, is also commonly used to provide information about the oceanic moisture sources where polar precipitation originates. Measurements of δ17O and “17O excess” (Δ17O) are also of interest because of their potential to provide information complementary to d. Such measurements are challenging because of the greater precision required, particularly for Δ17O. Here, high-precision measurements are reported for δ17O, δ18O, and δD on a new ice core from the South Pole, using a continuous-flow measurement system coupled to two cavity ring-down laser spectroscopy instruments. Replicate measurements show that at 0.5 cm resolution, external precision is ∼0.2‰ for δ17O and δ18O, and ∼1‰ for δD. For Δ17O, achieving external precision of <0.01‰ requires depth averages of ∼50 cm. The resulting ∼54,000-year record of the complete oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios from the South Pole ice core is discussed. The time series of Δ17O variations from the South Pole shows significant millennial-scale variability, and is correlated with the logarithmic formulation of deuterium excess (dln), but not the traditional linear formulation (d).},

We present various air temperature measurements together with other measurements of meteorological parameters using different sensor systems at a snow-covered and a vegetated site. Measurements from naturally ventilated air temperature sensors in multiplate shields are compared to temperatures measured using sonic anemometers which are unaffected by solar radiation. Over snow, 30 min mean temperature differences can be as large as 10°C. Unshielded thermocouples were also tested and are generally less affected by shortwave radiation. Temperature errors decrease with decreasing solar radiation and increasing wind speed but do not completely disappear at a given solar radiation even in the presence of effective ventilation. We show that temperature errors grow faster for reflected than for incident solar radiation, demonstrating the influence of the surface properties on radiative errors, and we detect the albedo as a variable with major influence on the magnitude of the error as well as a key quantity in possible error correction schemes. An extension is proposed for an existing similarity regression model to correct for radiative errors; thus, surface-reflected shortwave radiation is identified as a principal source of error and the key variable for obtaining a unique nondimensional scaling of radiative errors.

   abstract = {Glacial climate was characterised by two types of abrupt events. Greenland ice cores record Dansgaard-Oeschger events, marked by abrupt warming in-between cold, stadial phases. Six of these stadials appear related to major Heinrich events (HEs), identified from ice-rafted debris (IRD) and large excursions in carbon-and oxygen-stable isotopic ratios in North Atlantic deep sea sediments, documenting major ice sheet collapse events. This finding has led to the paradigm that glacial cold events are induced by the response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to such massive freshwater inputs, supported by sensitivity studies conducted with climate models of various complexities. These models also simulate synchronous Greenland temperature and lower-latitude hydrological changes. To investigate the sequence of events between climate changes at low latitudes and in Greenland, we provide here the first 17O-excess record from a Greenland ice core during Dansgaard-Oeschger events 7 to 13, encompassing H4 and H5. Combined with other ice core proxy records, our new 17O-excess data set demonstrates that stadials are generally characterised by low 17O-excess levels compared to interstadials. This can be interpreted as synchronous change of high-latitude temperature and lower-latitude hydrological cycle (relative humidity at the oceanic source of evaporation or change in the water mass trajectory/recharge) and/or an influence of local temperature on 17O-excess through kinetic effect at snow formation. As an exception from this general pattern, stadial 9 consists of three phases, characterised first by Greenland cooling during 550 ± 60 years (as shown by markers of Greenland temperature δ18O and δ15N), followed by a specific lower-latitude fingerprint as identified from several proxy records (abrupt decrease in 17O-excess, increase in CO2 and methane mixing ratio, heavier δD-CH4 and δ18Oatm), lasting 740 ± 60 years, itself ending approximately 390 ± 50 years prior to abrupt Greenland warming. We hypothesise that this lower-latitude signal may be the fingerprint of Heinrich event 4 in Greenland ice cores. The proposed decoupling between stable cold Greenland temperature and low-latitude climate variability identified for stadial 9 provides new targets for benchmarking climate model simulations and testing mechanisms associated with millennial variability.},

Combined with firn modeling, air isotope data allow us to quantify abrupt temperature increases for each drill site (1σ = 0.6 °C for NEEM, GRIP and GISP2, 1.5 °C for NGRIP). Our data show that the magnitude of stadial-interstadial temperature increase is up to 2 °C larger in central and North Greenland than in northwest Greenland: i.e., for DO 8, a magnitude of +8.8 °C is inferred, which is significantly smaller than the +11.1 °C inferred at GISP2. The same spatial pattern is seen for accumulation increases. This pattern is coherent with climate simulations in response to reduced sea-ice extent in the Nordic seas. The temporal water isotope (δ18O)-temperature relationship varies between 0.3 and 0.6 (±0.08)°C-1 and is systematically larger at NEEM, possibly due to limited changes in precipitation seasonality compared to GISP2, GRIP or NGRIP. The gas age-ice age difference of warming events represented in water and air isotopes can only be modeled when assuming a 26% (NGRIP) to 40% (GRIP) lower accumulation than that derived from a Dansgaard-Johnsen ice flow model. © Author(s) 2013.},

The onsets of both abrupt Greenland warmings were slightly preceded by decreasing Greenland dust deposition, reflecting the wetting of Asian deserts. A northern shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone could be the trigger of these abrupt shifts of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, resulting in changes of 2 to 4 kelvin in Greenland moisture source temperature from one year to the next.},

   abstract = {In order to reconstruct the temperature of the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) site, new measurements of δ15N have been performed covering the time period from the beginning of the Holocene to Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) event 8. Together with previously measured and mostly published δ15N data, we present for the first time a NGRIP temperature reconstruction for the whole last glacial period from 10 to 120 kyr b2k (thousand years before 2000 AD) including every DO event based on δ15N isotope measurements combined with a firn densification and heat diffusion model. The detected temperature rises at the onset of DO events range from 5 °C (DO 25) up to 16.5 °C (DO 11) with an uncertainty of ±3 °C. To bring measured and modelled data into agreement, we had to reduce the accumulation rate given by the NGRIP ss09sea06bm timescale in some periods by 30 to 35%, especially during the last glacial maximum. A comparison between reconstructed temperature and δ18Oice data confirms that the isotopic composition of the stadial was strongly influenced by seasonality. We evidence an anticorrelation between the variations of the δ18Oice sensitivity to temperature (referred to as α) and obliquity in agreement with a simple Rayleigh distillation model. Finally, we suggest that α might be influenced by the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet volume. © 2014 Author(s).},

@report{Johnsen1989,
   abstract = {At low altitude locations, the deuterium excess d = 6 0-8 6 1 8 0 in precipitation generally varies with the season in antiphase with the 6's. In the high-altitude regions of the Greenland ice sheet, however, d in the snow varies with only a few months time lag behind the 6's. A model for d values in Greenland precipitation is developed on the basis of Rayleigh condensation/sublimation with due account taken of kinetic effects during both evaporation of sea water and sublimation. The model predicts that the initial mixing ratio w,, in precipitating air determines the slope of the d versus 6 relationship at late stages of the precipitation process, and that the sea surface temperature T, in the source area of the moisture only influences the d level. The generally high d-values in ice sheet precipitation are compatible only with high values of w, and Ts, which suggests the subtropical part of the North Atlantic Ocean as a dominating moisture source for ice sheet precipitation. This is supported experimentally: when the model is run with monthly w, and T, mean values oberved at Ship E (35"N. 48"W), it reproduces the high d level, the amplitude of the seasonal d variations, and the few months phase difference between d and 6 on the ice sheet. None of these features can be reproduced with a local, high-latitude moisture source. Detailed isotope analyses of ice core increments, spanning several abrupt climatic shifts under glacial conditions, show close to present d values during the cold phases, but lower d values during the mild phases. This feature is discussed in the light of the model experiments.},

With common strong stratification, similarity theory becomes unreliable. The turbulence structure and interactions with the mean flow and small-scale nonturbulent motions assume a variety of scenarios. The turbulence is intermittent and may no longer fully satisfy the usual conditions for the definition of turbulence. Nonturbulent motions include wave-like motions and solitary modes, two-dimensional vortical modes, microfronts, intermittent drainage flows, and a host of more complex structures. The main source of turbulence may not be at the surface, but rather may result from shear above the surface inversion. The turbulence is typically not in equilibrium with the nonturbulent motions, sometimes preventing the formation of an inertial subrange.

   abstract = {A field experiment-the Snow Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (SnoHATS)-has been performed over an extensive glacier in Switzerland in order to study small-scale turbulence in the stable atmospheric surface layer, and to investigate the role, dynamics and modelling of the subgrid scales (SGSs) in the context of large-eddy simulations. The a priori data analysis aims at comparing the role and behaviour of the SGSs under stable conditions with previous studies under neutral or unstable conditions. It is found that the SGSs in a stable surface layer remain an important sink of temperature variance and turbulent kinetic energy from the resolved scales and carry a significant portion of the fluxes when the filter scale is larger than the distance to the wall. The fraction of SGS fluxes (out of the total fluxes) is found to be independent of stability. In addition, the stress-strain alignment is similar to the alignment under neutral and unstable conditions. The model coefficients vary considerably with stability but in a manner consistent with previous findings, which also showed that scale-dependent dynamic models can capture this variation. Furthermore, the variation of the coefficients for both momentum and heat SGS fluxes can be shown to be better explained by stability parameters based on vertical gradients, rather than vertical fluxes. These findings suggest that small-scale turbulence dynamics and SGS modelling under stable conditions share many important properties with neutral and convective conditions, and that a unified approach is thus possible. This paper concludes with a discussion of some other challenges for stable boundary-layer simulations that are not encountered in the neutral or unstable cases. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

   abstract = {Direct numerical simulation of the turbulent Ekman layer over a smooth wall is used to investigate bulk properties of a planetary boundary layer under stable stratification. Our simplified configuration depends on two non-dimensional parameters: a Richardson number characterizing the stratification and a Reynolds number characterizing the turbulence scale separation. This simplified configuration is sufficient to reproduce global intermittency, a turbulence collapse, and the decoupling of the surface from the outer region of the boundary layer. Global intermittency appears even in the absence of local perturbations at the surface; the only requirement is that large-scale structures several times wider than the boundary-layer height have enough space to develop. Analysis of the mean velocity, turbulence kinetic energy, and external intermittency is used to investigate the large-scale structures and corresponding differences between stably stratified Ekman flow and channel flow. Both configurations show a similar transition to the turbulence collapse, overshoot of turbulence kinetic energy, and spectral properties. Differences in the outer region resulting from the rotation of the system lead, however, to the generation of enstrophy in the non-turbulent patches of the Ekman flow. The coefficient of the stability correction function from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory is estimated as β ≈ 5.7 in agreement with atmospheric observations, theoretical considerations, and results from stably stratified channel flows. Our results demonstrate the applicability of this set-up to atmospheric problems despite the intermediate Reynolds number achieved in our simulations. © 2014 The Author(s).},

The seasonal cycle of cloud cover is found to range from 45%-50% during the short summer to a relatively constant 55%-65% during the winter. Relationships between C pyr and 2-m temperature, 10-m wind speed and direction, and longwave radiation are investigated. It is shown that clouds warm the surface in all seasons, 0.5-1 K during summer and 3-4 K during winter. The annual longwave cloud radiative forcing is 18 W m 2 for downwelling radiation and 10 W m 2 for net radiation. The cloud cover datasets are intercompared during the time periods in which they overlap. The nighttime bias of C vis is worse than previously suspected, by approximately 20%; C ISCCP shows some skill during the polar day, while C APP-x shows some skill at night. The polar cloud masks for the satellite data reviewed here are not yet accurate enough to reliably derive surface or cloud properties over the East Antarctic Plateau. The best surface-based source of cloud cover in terms of the combination of accuracy and length of record is determined to be C pyr. The use of the C pyr dataset for further tests of satellite retrievals and for tests of polar models is recommended.},

While the properties of water at interfaces differ from those in the bulk, major gaps in our knowledge limit our understanding at the molecular level. Information concerning the microscopic motion of water comes mostly from computation and, on an atomic scale, is largely unexplored by experiment. Here, we provide a detailed insight into the behaviour of water monomers on a graphene surface. The motion displays remarkably strong signatures of cooperative behaviour due to repulsive forces between the monomers, enhancing the monomer lifetime (≈ 3 s at 125 K) in a free-gas phase that precedes the nucleation of ice islands and, in turn, provides the opportunity for our experiments to be performed. Our results give a molecular perspective on a kinetic barrier to ice nucleation, providing routes to understand and control the processes involved in ice formation.},

Measuring and comparing natural isotopic variations requires reliable primary reference materials and consistent data treatment. However, these reference materials have changed over time, while advances in technology have led to better constrained isotopic compositions of the reference materials. In this Technical Review, we provide an overview of the historical evolution of such materials, and explain their relationships across time and isotopic scales. Recommendations are provided for the measurement and reporting of isotopic compositions against the consensual VPDB and VSMOW scales in light of the newest carbonate and water reference materials distributed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Stable isotope fractionation factors and their temperature dependence in processes specific to the water cycle (2H, 18O, 17O) and the CO2–water–carbonate system (13C, 18O) are described, including for carbonate clumped isotope thermometry. Propagation of errors is also addressed for a consistent reporting of real uncertainties of isotopic measurements and calculations. Lastly, current gaps in knowledge on the behaviour of stable isotopes in the water cycle and the CO2–water–carbonate system are highlighted for future studies.},

   abstract = {Data from the South Pole ice core (SPC14) are used to constrain climate conditions and ice-flow-induced layer thinning for the last 54,000 years. Empirical constraints are obtained from the SPC14 ice and gas timescales, used to calculate annual-layer thickness and the gas-ice age difference (Δage), and from high-resolution measurements of water isotopes, used to calculate the water-isotope diffusion length. Both Δage and diffusion length depend on firn properties and therefore contain information about past temperature and snow-accumulation rate. A statistical inverse approach is used to obtain an ensemble of reconstructions of temperature, accumulation-rate, and thinning of annual layers in the ice sheet at the SPC14 site. The traditional water-isotope/temperature relationship is not used as a constraint; the results therefore provide an independent calibration of that relationship. The temperature reconstruction yields a glacial-interglacial temperature change of 6.7 ± 1.0°C at the South Pole. The sensitivity of δ18O to temperature is 0.99 ± 0.03 ‰°C−1, significantly greater than the spatial slope of 0.8‰°C−1 that has been used previously to determine temperature changes from East Antarctic ice core records. The reconstructions of accumulation rate and ice thinning show millennial-scale variations in the thinning function as well as decreased thinning at depth compared to the results of a 1-D ice flow model, suggesting influence of bedrock topography on ice flow.},

Additionally, knowledge of the spatial variability in SMB at ice core drilling sites helps to interpret the spatial representativeness of SMB data obtained from a single ice core. In this study, to investigate the spatiotemporal variability in recent SMB in the East Greenland Ice Core Project (EGRIP) area in the northeastern Greenland ice sheet, pit observations were made at six sites in the summers of 2016–2018. In all pits, depth profiles of water isotope ratios showed clear seasonal variations. The annual SMB differed from site to site, which is probably due to post-depositional redistribution of snow caused by wind erosion and snowdrift. However, the multiple-site averages of annual SMBs, which ranged from 134 to 157 mm w. e. yr−1 (average 146 mm w. e. yr−1) during 2009–2017, were very similar. This indicates that annual SMBs in the EGRIP area were nearly constant in this period. The seasonal SMBs in the EGRIP area tended to be larger in the summer–winter period than in the winter–summer period.},

In his classical paper published in 1938, FINDEISEN described the contemporary understanding of the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process and other key cloud microphysical processes. Here, we compare the understanding of the aforementioned processes at the time with that of the present, and find that they are remarkably similar.

   abstract = {This paper presents the results of a three year sampling of the isotopic composition (δ18O and δ2Η) of atmospheric water vapor in Patras, Greece. Since the distribution of stable isotopes in precipitation/water vapor is strongly affected by the climatic conditions occurring over a certain area, the link between the isotopic composition of water vapor and meteorological parameters is examined. Air temperature partly modulates the isotopic composition explaining only a small amount of the overall isotopic variation. The temperature effect for δ18Ο is more remarkable in the vapor phase providing a higher isotope-temperature slope for monthly water vapor (0.5‰/°C) in comparison to that of precipitation (0.32‰/°C). The seasonality effect of the vapor δ18Ο data is determined by applying a sinusoidal model. The modeled peak of the seasonal effect is observed in the beginning of June with amplitude equal to 1.22‰ fluctuating around -13‰. Furthermore the mean monthly isotopic composition of water vapor in Patras is compared against those of several sampling stations of the Northern Hemisphere. The mean monthly isotopic variation reflects the overall characteristics of the coastal locations (i.e. Rehovot) providing a lower seasonal amplitude in comparison to continental stations. Finally, in order to identify the potential sources affecting the D-excess of water vapor a Concentration Weighted Trajectory model was used. Back trajectory analysis combined with the isotopic information was used to calculate the concentration fields. Air parcels coming from the north-westerly direction affect the region of Patras implying that this north-western flow contributes to the observed D-excess variability.},

Three of the models, the CCCMA-CGCM3.1(T63), the MIROC3.2(hires), and the MPI-ECHAM5, best reproduce the ERA-40 synoptic climatology and are chosen for further analysis of precipitation over Greenland. The MIROC3.2(hires) is the best single performing model, in that it best matches ERA-40. Although the three-model ensemble simulates the same mean annual precipitation over Greenland as ERA-40, the ensemble simulates the mean annual precipitation differently than ERA-40. A dry bias in the CCCMA-CGCM3.1(T63) and a wet bias from the MPI-ECHAM5 cancel in the ensemble average. The mean annual precipitation difference between the model ensemble, as well as each individual model, and ERA-40 is then attributed to differences in intrapattern variability and pattern frequency components in the models that make up the ensemble. Pattern frequency differences between the model and ERA-40 indicate a difference in the occurrence of synoptic weather patterns, while intrapattern variability differences denote differences in the amount of precipitation produced when a given synoptic weather pattern occurs. Intrapattern variability differences between the models and ERA-40 are predominantly responsible for Greenland precipitation differences, but pattern frequency (circulation) differences in the models also play a small role. Part 2 of this paper uses this three-model ensemble to analyze and attribute predicted increases in precipitation over the Greenland ice sheet for the 21st century.

   abstract = {Monin–Obukhov similarity theory is used in large-eddy simulation (LES) models as a surface boundary condition to predict the surface shear stress and scalar fluxes based on the gradients between the surface and the first grid level above the surface. We outline deficiencies of this methodology, such as the systematical underestimation of the surface shear stress, and propose a modified boundary condition to correct for this issue. The proposed boundary condition is applied to a set of LES for both neutral and stable boundary layers with successively decreasing grid spacing. The results indicate that the proposed boundary condition reliably corrects the surface shear stress and the sensible heat flux, and improves grid convergence of these quantities. The LES data indicate improved grid convergence for the surface shear stress, more so than for the surface heat flux. This is either due to a limited performance of the Monin–Obukhov similarity functions or due to problems in the LES model in representing stable conditions. Furthermore, we find that the correction achieved using the proposed boundary condition does not lead to improved grid convergence of the wind-speed and temperature profiles. From this we conclude that the sensitivity of the wind-speed and temperature profiles in the LES model to the grid spacing is more likely related to under-resolved near-surface gradients and turbulent mixing at the boundary-layer top, to the SGS model formulation, and/or to numerical issues, and not to deficiencies due to the use of improper surface boundary conditions.},

   abstract = {For the first time a simulation of blowing snow events was validated in detail using one-month long observations (January 2010) made in Adélie Land, Antarctica. A regional climate model featuring a coupled atmosphere/blowing snow/snowpack model is forced laterally by meteorological re-analyses. The vertical grid spacing was 2 m from 2 to 20 m above the surface and the horizontal grid spacing was 5 km. The simulation was validated by comparing the occurrence of blowing snow events and other meteorological parameters at two automatic weather stations. The Nash test allowed us to compute efficiencies of the simulation. The regional climate model simulated the observed wind speed with a positive efficiency (0. 69). Wind speeds higher than 12 m s-1 were underestimated. Positive efficiency of the simulated wind speed was a prerequisite for validating the blowing snow model. Temperatures were simulated with a slightly negative efficiency (-0.16) due to overestimation of the amplitude of the diurnal cycle during one week, probably because the cloud cover was underestimated at that location during the period concerned. Snowfall events were correctly simulated by our model, as confirmed by field reports. Because observations suggested that our instrument (an acoustic sounder) tends to overestimate the blowing snow flux, data were not sufficiently accurate to allow the complete validation of snow drift values. However, the simulation of blowing snow occurrence was in good agreement with the observations made during the first 20 days of January 2010, despite the fact that the blowing snow flux may be underestimated by the regional climate model during pure blowing snow events. We found that blowing snow occurs in Adélie Land only when the 30-min wind speed value at 2 m a.g.l. is >10 m s-1. The validation for the last 10 days of January 2010 was less satisfactory because of complications introduced by surface melting and refreezing. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {Ice cores from polar ice sheets and glaciers are an important climate archive. Snow layers, consecutively deposited and buried, contain climatic information from the time of their formation. However, particularly low-Accumulation areas are characterised by temporally intermittent precipitation, which can be further redistributed after initial deposition, depending on the local surface features at different spatial scales. Therefore, the accumulation conditions at an ice core site influence the quantity and quality of the recorded climate signal in proxy records. This study aims to characterise the local accumulation patterns and the evolution of the snow height to describe the contribution of the snow (re-)deposition to the overall noise level in climate records from ice cores. To this end, we applied a structure-from-motion photogrammetry approach to generate near-daily elevation models of the surface snow for a 195g€¯m2 area in the vicinity of the deep drilling site of the East Greenland Ice-core Project in northeast Greenland. Based on the snow height information we derive snow height changes on a day-To-day basis throughout our observation period from May to August 2018 and find an average snow height increase of g1/4g€¯11g€¯cm. The spatial and temporal data set also allows an investigation of snow deposition versus depositional modifications. We observe irregular snow deposition and erosion causing uneven snow accumulation patterns, a removal of more than 60g€¯% of the deposited snow, and a negative relationship between the initial snow height and the amount of accumulated snow. Furthermore, the surface roughness decreased by approximately a factor of 2 throughout the spring and summer season at our study site. Finally, our study shows that structure from motion is a relatively simple method to demonstrate the potential influences of depositional processes on proxy signals in snow and ice.},

   abstract = {We investigate an intense snowfall event between 15 and 18 February 2011 over the East Antarctic coastal region which contributed to roughly 24% of the annual snow accumulation. The event was previously associated with an atmospheric river, and here we use both Eulerian and Lagrangian analysis to gain an understanding of the processes contributing to the atmospheric river signature. The planetary-scale configuration during the event consisted of a persistent blocking situation resulting in a sustained meridional flow from the sub-tropics to the Antarctic ice sheet between 20 and 50°E. Within this configuration, synoptic-scale cyclogenesis contributed to slantwise ascent of moisture loaded air parcels toward Antarctica. Landfall of this cyclone’s warm sector coincided with the onset of Antarctic precipitation. Subsequently, a secondary cyclone developed along a pre-existing baroclinic zone. The rapid intensification and propagation speed of this mesoscale cyclone alongside the warm, moist air mass resulted in strong moisture flux convergence ahead of the cyclone, providing additional poleward moisture transport. The poleward progression of warm moist air and a corresponding decrease of sea-surface temperatures implied downward surface sensible and latent heat fluxes throughout the region of intense poleward moisture, roughly between 40 and 60°S. Hence, moisture uptake via surface evaporation was suppressed between the sub-tropics and the polar continent, favoring long-range transport. Identification of the surface moisture uptake region by tracing changes in moisture in air parcels confirmed the limited uptake of moisture during the poleward transport in this case study, with the primary moisture source for Antarctic precipitation located in the sub-tropics.},

   abstract = {Dry snow metamorphism under an external temperature gradient is the most common type of recrystallization of snow on the ground. The changes in snow microstructure modify the physical properties of snow, and therefore an understanding of this process is essential for many disciplines, from modeling the effects of snow on climate to assessing avalanche risk. We directly imaged the microstructural changes in snow during temperature gradient metamorphism (TGM) under a constant gradient of 50 K mĝ̂'1, using in situ time-lapse X-ray micro-tomography. This novel and non-destructive technique directly reveals the amount of ice that sublimates and is deposited during metamorphism, in addition to the exact locations of these phase changes. We calculated the average time that an ice volume stayed in place before it sublimated and found a characteristic residence time of 2-3 days. This means that most of the ice changes its phase from solid to vapor and back many times in a seasonal snowpack where similar temperature conditions can be found. Consistent with such a short timescale, we observed a mass turnover of up to 60% of the total ice mass per day. The concept of hand-to-hand transport for the water vapor flux describes the observed changes very well. However, we did not find evidence for a macroscopic vapor diffusion enhancement. The picture of \{temperature gradient metamorphism\} produced by directly observing the changing microstructure sheds light on the micro-physical processes and could help to improve models that predict the physical properties of snow. © Author(s) 2012.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE The equilibrium fractionation factors govern the relative change in the isotopic composition during phase transitions of water. The commonly used results, which were published more than 40 years ago, are limited to a minimum temperature of -33°C. This limits the reliability in cold regions. With recent instrumental developments it is now possible to test the accuracy of the earlier results as well as extend the temperature range. METHODS Novel measurements were made of the ice-vapor equilibrium fractionation factor α between 0°C and -40°C, from a unique experimental setup using both a Picarro cavity ringdown spectrometer and a TC/EA IRMS system. Using both systems allows for continuous monitoring of the equilibrium state of the system as well as testing for reproducibility. RESULTS The results of the experiments show fractionation factors for δ2H and δ18O values, with a temperature dependency in accordance with theory for equilibrium fractionation. We obtain the following expressions for the temperature dependency of the fractionation coefficients: lnαδ2H=0.2133-203. 10T+48888T2lnαδ18O=0.0831-49.192T+8312.5T2 Compared with previous experimental work, a significantly larger α for δ2H is obtained while, for δ18O, α is larger for temperatures below -20°C and slightly lower for temperatures above this. CONCLUSIONS Using the new values for α, a Rayleigh distillation model shows significant changes in both magnitude and shape of an annual deuterium excess signal in Greenland. This emphasizes the importance of a well-defined value of α for accurate studies of the processes in the hydrological cycle and underlines the significance of the differences between the results of this work and earlier work.

Here we present an experimental study on the effect of airflow on the snow isotopic composition through a snow pack in controlled laboratory conditions. The influence of isothermal and controlled temperature gradient conditions on the δ18O content in the snow and interstitial water vapour is elucidated. The observed disequilibrium between snow and vapour isotopes led to the exchange of isotopes between snow and vapour under non-equilibrium processes, significantly changing the δ18O content of the snow. The type of metamorphism of the snow had a significant influence on this process. These findings are pertinent to the interpretation of the records of stable isotopes of water from ice cores. These laboratory measurements suggest that a highly resolved climate history is relevant for the interpretation of the snow isotopic composition in the field.},

   abstract = {Stable water isotopes from polar ice cores are invaluable high-resolution climate proxy records. Recent studies have aimed to improve knowledge of how the climate signal is stored in the water isotope record by addressing the influence of post-depositional processes on the surface snow isotopic composition. In this study, the relationship between changes in surface snow microstructure after precipitation/deposition events and water isotopes is explored using measurements of snow specific 5 surface area (SSA). Continuous daily SSA measurements from the East Greenland Ice Core Project site (EastGRIP) situated in the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the summer seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019 are used to develop an empirical decay model to describe events of rapid decrease in SSA, driven predominantly by vapour diffusion in the pore space and atmospheric vapour exchange. The SSA decay model is described by the exponential equation SSA(t) = (SSA 0 − 26.8) e −0.54 t + 26.8. The model performance is optimal for daily mean values of surface temperature in the range 0 • C to-25 • C 10 and wind speed < 6 m s −1. The findings from the SSA analysis are used to explore the influence of surface snow metamorphism on altering the isotopic composition of surface snow. It is found that rapid SSA decay events correspond to decreases in d-excess over a 2-day period in 72 % of the samples. Detailed studies using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis revealed a coherence between the dominant mode of variance of SSA and d-excess during periods of low spatial variability of surface snow over the sampling transect, suggesting that processes driving change in SSA also influence d-excess. Our findings 15 highlight the need for future studies to decouple the processes driving surface snow metamorphism in order to quantify the fractionation effect of individual processes on the snow isotopic composition.},

   abstract = {Meteorological and glaciological data obtained over an intensive 2 year measurement period (2000–2002) are used to run a physically based climatic mass balance model to characterize a seasonal variability in mass and energy exchanges at Summit, Greenland. The model resolves the full surface energy balance and the subsurface temperature profile by inclusion of energy release from penetrating shortwave radiation. A Monte Carlo approach using 1000 different parameter combinations is adopted to assess model uncertainty, with output compared to measured surface and subsurface temperatures, changes in surface height, and eddy correlation data. The heat exchanges associated with the change in phase of water are very small in all seasons, with the average turbulent latent heat flux equal to 0.4 (±0.2) W m-2. This suggests that the mean annual water vapor gradient is toward the surface, resulting in a mass gain of 4.1 mm WE yr-1.The mass gain represents only a small fraction of the total accumulation (<2%), in part because of the change in sign of the water vapor flux from winter (deposition) to summer (sublimation), but if assumed to be typical of the entire dry snow zone (40% of the total ice sheet area) is equivalent to approximately 5.5 Gt yr-1. A simple experiment based on 2012 atmospheric conditions suggests that mass turnover from water vapor exchanges will likely be enhanced in a warming climate, with sublimation increasing more than deposition. Should the sign of the mean turbulent latent heat flux change due to warming, the present mass gain in the dry snow zone could easily become a mass loss of equal proportion, which would further enhance the negative mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet.},

   abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the processes that couple the lower atmosphere to the upper surface of ice sheets is necessary for interpreting ice-core records. Of special interest are those processes that involve the exchange of energy or atmospheric constituents. One such process , wind pumping, entai ls both possibilities and provides a possible mechanism for converting atmospheric kinetic energy into a near-surface heat source within the firn layer. The essential idea is that temporal and spatial variations in surface air pressure, resulting from air motion, can diffuse into permeable firn by conventional Darcy flow. Viscous friction between moving air and the solid firn matrix leads to energy dissipation in the firn that is equ iva lent to a volumetric heat source. Initi al theoretical work on wind pumping was aimed at explaining anomalous near-surface temperatures measured at sites on Agassiz Ice Cap, Arctic Canada. A conclusion of this preliminary work was that, under highly favourable conditions, anomalous warming of as much as 2°C was possible. Subsequent efforts to confirm wind-pumping predictions suggest that our initial estimates of the penet ration depth for pressure fluctuations were optimistic. These observations point to Lt deficiency of the initial theoretical formulation-the surface-pressure forcing was assumed to vary temporally, but not spatially. Thus, within the firn there was on ly a surface-normal component of air flow. The purpose of the present contribution is to advance a three-dimensional theory of wind pumping in which air flow is driven by both spatial a nd temporal fluctuations in surface pressure. Conclusion s of the three-dimensional analysis are that the penetration of pressure fluctuations, and hence the thickness of the zone of frictional interaction between air and permeable firn, is related to both the frequency of the pressure fluctuations and to the sp at ial coherence lengt h of turbulence cells near the firn surface.},

   abstract = {The isotopic composition of water in ice sheets is extensively used to infer past climate changes. In low-accumulation regions their interpretation is, however, challenged by poorly constrained effects that may influence the initial isotope signal during and after deposition of the snow. This is reflected in snow-pit isotope data from Kohnen Station, Antarctica, which exhibit a seasonal cycle but also strong interannual variations that contradict local temperature observations. These inconsistencies persist even after averaging many profiles and are thus not explained by local stratigraphic noise. Previous studies have suggested that post-depositional processes may significantly influence the isotopic composition of East Antarctic firn. Here, we investigate the importance of post-depositional processes within the open-porous firn (≥10 cm depth) at Kohnen Station by separating spatial from temporal variability. To this end, we analyse 22 isotope profiles obtained from two snow trenches and examine the temporal isotope modifications by comparing the new data with published trench data extracted 2 years earlier. The initial isotope profiles undergo changes over time due to downward advection, firn diffusion and densification in magnitudes consistent with independent estimates. Beyond that, we find further modifications of the original isotope record to be unlikely or small in magnitude (<1%RMSD). These results show that the discrepancy between local temperatures and isotopes most likely originates from spatially coherent processes prior to or during deposition, such as precipitation intermittency or systematic isotope modifications acting on drifting or loose surface snow.},

Supercooled liquid clouds can exist at temperatures as low as 235 K, and the radiative effect of these clouds depends on the complex refractive index (CRI) of liquid water. Laboratory measurements have demonstrated that the liquid-water CRI is temperature-dependent, but corroboration with field measurements is difficult. Here we present measurements of the downwelling infrared radiance and in-situ measurements of supercooled liquid water in a cloud at temperatures as low as 240 K, made at South Pole Station in 2001. These results demonstrate that including the temperature dependence of the liquid-water CRI is essential for accurate calculations of radiative transfer through supercooled liquid clouds. Furthermore, we show that when cloud properties are retrieved from infrared radiances (using the spectral range 500–1,200 cm−1) spurious ice may be retrieved if the 300 K CRI is used for cold liquid clouds (∼240 K). These results have implications for radiative transfer in climate models as well as for retrievals of cloud properties from infrared radiance spectra.},

Vertical profiles of density, specific surface area (SSA) and thermal conductivity were measured on tundra, lakes and landfast ice. The average thickness was 41 cm on tundra and 21 cm on fast ice. Layers observed were diamond dust or recent wind drifts on top, overlaying wind slabs, occasional faceted crystals and melt-freeze crusts, and basal depth hoar layers. The top layer had a SSA between 45 and 224 m<sup>2</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup>. All layers at Barrow had SSAs higher than at many other places because of the geographical and climatic characteristics of Barrow. In particular, a given snow layer was remobilized several times by frequent winds, which resulted in SSA increases each time. The average snow area index (SAI, the dimensionless vertically integrated SSA) on tundra was 3260, higher than in the Canadian High Arctic or in the Alaskan taiga. This high SAI, combined with low snow temperatures, imply that the Barrow snowpack efficiently traps persistent organic pollutants, as illustrated with simple calculations for PCB 28 and PCB 180. The average thermal conductivity was 0.21 Wm<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, and the average thermal resistance on tundra was 3.25 m<sup>2</sup> K W<sup>-1</sup>. This low value partly explains why the snow-ground interface was cold, around-19°C. The high SAI and low thermal resistance values illustrate the interplay between climate, snow physical properties, and their potential impact on atmospheric chemistry, and the need to describe these relationships in models of polar climate and atmospheric chemistry, especially in a climate change context.

We profiled them in oblique section and nearly parallel to the prevailing wind.

The apparent subglacial control implies that the accumulation progrades in balance with ice velocity, which we measured at ̃30ma -1. The sequences prograde over intensely modified and recrystallized wind-glaze firn, visible in the profiles as unstratified layers and zones up to several tens of meters thick. The intense recrystallization eliminates density stratification, and the altered layers appear to thicken into a connected network. Modeling of coset formation using wind and ice flow reproduces their dimensions and morphology. However, accumulation rates well above current regional estimates and existing data for megadunes are required because of the measured ice speed and required slope stability.

The stratigraphic variation includes up to 30 m depth variation in individual horizons over tens of km, fold limbs that become progressively steeper with depth, and fold-hinge loci that change direction or propagate down-ice with depth over distances far less than predicted by the ice speeds.

   abstract = {In order to understand the evolution of the climate of Antarctica, dominant processes that control surface and low-atmosphere meteorology need to be accurately captured in climate models. We used the regional climate model MAR (v3.11) at 10gkm horizontal resolution, forced by ERA5 reanalysis over a 9-year period (2010-2018) to study the impact of drifting snow (designating here the wind-driven transport of snow particles below and above 2gm) on the near-surface atmosphere and surface in Adelie Land, East Antarctica. Two model runs were performed, one with and one without drifting snow, and compared to half-hourly in situ observations at D17, a coastal and windy location of Adelie Land. We show that sublimation of drifting-snow particles in the atmosphere drives the difference between model runs and is responsible for significant impacts on the near-surface atmosphere. By cooling the low atmosphere and increasing its relative humidity, drifting snow also reduces sensible and latent heat exchanges at the surface (-5.7gWgm-2 on average). Moreover, large and dense drifting-snow layers act as near-surface cloud by interacting with incoming radiative fluxes, enhancing incoming longwave radiation and reducing incoming shortwave radiation in summer (net radiative forcing: 5.7gWgm-2). Even if drifting snow modifies these processes involved in surface-atmosphere interactions, the total surface energy budget is only slightly modified by introducing drifting snow because of compensating effects in surface energy fluxes. The drifting-snow driven effects are not prominent near the surface but peak higher in the boundary layer (fourth vertical level, 12gm) where drifting-snow sublimation is the most pronounced. Accounting for drifting snow in MAR generally improves the comparison at D17, especially for the representation of relative humidity (mean bias reduced from -14.0g% to -0.7g%) and incoming longwave radiation (mean bias reduced from -20.4gWgm-2 to -14.9gWgm-2). Consequently, our results suggest that a detailed representation of drifting-snow processes is required in climate models to better capture the near-surface meteorology and surface-atmosphere interactions in coastal Adelie Land.},

Results from aerodynamic profile methods are compared with eddy correlation and evaporation pan measurements. Two profile method types are applied to hourly data sets spanning 1995.4 to 2000.4. One method type is shown to accurately gauge sublimation using two humidity and wind speed measurement levels. The other "bulk" method type is shown to underestimate condensation, as it assumes surface saturation. General climate models employ bulk methods and, consequently, underestimate deposition. Loss of water vapor by the surface predominates in summer at lower elevations, where bulk methods agree better with two-level methods. Annual net water vapor flux from the two-level method is as great as -87 ±27 mm at 960 m elevation and -74 ±23 mm at equilibrium line altitude in western Greenland. At an undulation trough site, net deposition is observed (+40 mm ±12). At the adjacent crest site 6 km away and at 50 m higher elevation, net sublimation predominates. At high-elevation sites, the annual water vapor flux is positive, up to +32 ±9 mm at the North Greenland Ice core Project (NGRIP) and +6 ±2 mm at Summit.

A sensitivity study removing high ice clouds demonstrates that the primary impact of these clouds at Summit is to reduce cloud liquid water embedded within the ice cloud and water vapor in the boundary layer due to vapor deposition on snow. The mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds form at the base of cold, dry air masses advected from the northwest above 4 km. The net surface radiative fluxes during the stratocumulus period are at least 20 W m-2 larger than during the ice cloud period, indicating that, in seasons other than summer, cold, dry air masses advected to Summit above the boundary layer may radiatively warm the top of the Greenland Ice Sheet more effectively than warm, moist air masses advected from lower latitudes.},

   abstract = {Tropopause polar vortices (TPVs) are long-lived, coherent vortices that are based on the dynamic tropopause and characterized by potential vorticity anomalies. TPVs exist primarily in the Arctic, with potential impacts ranging from surface cyclone generation and Rossby wave interactions to dynamic changes in sea ice. Previous analyses have focused on model output indicating the importance of clear-sky and cloud-top radiative cooling in the maintenance and evolution of TPVs, but no studies have focused on local observations to confirm or deny these results. This study uses cloud and atmospheric state observations from Summit Station, Greenland, combined with single-column experiments using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model to investigate the effects of clear-sky, ice-only, and all-sky radiative cooling on TPV intensification. The ground-based observing system combined with temperature and humidity profiles from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’s fifth major global reanalysis dataset, which assimilates the twice-daily soundings launched at Summit, provides novel details of local characteristics of TPVs. Longwave radiative contributions to TPV diabatic intensity changes are analyzed with these resources, starting with a case study focusing on observed cloud properties and associated radiative effects, followed by a composite study used to evaluate observed results alongside previously simulated results. Stronger versus weaker vertical gradients in anomalous clear-sky radiative heating rates, contributing to Ertel potential vorticity changes, are associated with strengthening versus weakening TPVs. Results show that clouds are sometimes influential in the intensification of a TPV, and composite results share many similarities to modeling studies in terms of atmospheric state and radiative structure.},

Mineral dust concentrations as well as stable water isotope (δ 18 O, δD, and deuterium excess) and major ion (F − , Cl − , NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, methanesulfonic acid (MSA), Na + , NH4+, Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ) concentrations were analyzed in this study. The seasonal δ 18 O and δD cycles indicate that the snowpit samples covered the period from winter 2012 to summer 2017. The concentrations of mineral dust and Ca 2+ showed seasonal deposition events with maxima in the spring layers. The concentrations of MSA exhibited maxima in the summer layers, making them useful indicators for the summer season. Moreover, an anomalous non-sea salt SO42- (nss SO42-) event was recorded at a depth of 130 − 85 cm that corresponded to the Holuhraun eruption (31 August 2014). In addition, a significant short-term cooling effect was observed. A back-trajectory analysis suggests that a major ash event from Iceland contributed to the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). These results provide insight for future studies of the EGRIP ice core.},

   abstract = {While snow accumulation over central Greenland has been extensively studied, interannual variability of snowfall in the region is not well understood due to a dearth of observations. The Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project at Summit, Greenland, offers a unique, ground-based opportunity to study precipitation in central Greenland where the surface mass balance is positive. Combining data from a Precipitation Occurrence Sensor System (POSS), Millimeter-wavelength Cloud Radar (MMCR), and snow stake field, the annual cycle of precipitation at Summit is examined. Average daily snowfall is higher by a factor of 3 from June to October compared to November to May, while surface height change is only higher by 15% during the same timeframes. This reduced variability in surface height is explained by the seasonally varying nature of latent heat flux, compaction, and wind contributions. The ICECAPS remote sensors and stake field measurements do not agree as far as total annual water equivalent. This discrepancy is likely due to a low bias in the POSS andMMCR snowfall retrievals for Summit. To further examine the seasonal cycle, snowfall measurements by the POSS were linked to local meteorological parameters, including wind direction, liquid water path (LWP), 2m temperature, and precipitable water vapor. An observedwind direction andmoisture dependence are consistent with snowfall being linked to pulses of moist air that originate over nearby, ice-free ocean, a resource that becomes more readily available in summertime as the winter sea ice retreats. LWP is shown to have little relationship to snowfall, indicating that ice-phase precipitation processes are quite important for snowfall at Summit.},

   abstract = {Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures are controlled by an exchange of energy at the surface, which includes radiative, turbulent, and ground heat fluxes. Data collected by multiple projects are leveraged to calculate all surface energy budget (SEB) terms at Summit, Greenland, for the full annual cycle from July 2013 to June 2014 and extend to longer periods for the radiative and turbulent SEB terms. Radiative fluxes are measured directly by a suite of broadband radiometers. Turbulent sensible heat flux is estimated via the bulk aerodynamic and eddy correlation methods, and the turbulent latent heat flux is calculated via a two-level approach using measurements at 10 and 2 m. The subsurface heat flux is calculated using a string of thermistors buried in the snow pack. Extensive quality-control data processing produced a data set in which all terms of the SEB are present 75 % of the full annual cycle, despite the harsh conditions. By including a storage term for a near-surface layer, the SEB is balanced in this data set to within the aggregated uncertainties for the individual terms. November and August case studies illustrate that surface radiative forcing is driven by synoptically forced cloud characteristics, especially by low-level, liquid-bearing clouds. The annual cycle and seasonal diurnal cycles of all SEB components indicate that the non-radiative terms are anticorrelated to changes in the total radiative flux and are hence responding to cloud radiative forcing. Generally, the non-radiative SEB terms and the upwelling longwave radiation component compensate for changes in downwelling radiation, although exact partitioning of energy in the response terms varies with season and near-surface characteristics such as stability and moisture availability. Substantial surface warming from low-level clouds typically leads to a change from a very stable to a weakly stable near-surface regime with no solar radiation or from a weakly stable to neutral/unstable regime with solar radiation. Relationships between forcing terms and responding surface fluxes show that the upwelling longwave radiation produces 65-85 % (50-60 %) of the total response in the winter (summer) and the non-radiative terms compensate for the remaining change in the combined downwelling longwave and net shortwave radiation. Because melt conditions are rarely reached at Summit, these relationships are documented for conditions of surface temperature below 0 °C, with and without solar radiation. This is the first time that forcing and response term relationships have been investigated in detail for the Greenland SEB. These results should both advance understanding of process relationships over the Greenland Ice Sheet and be useful for model validation.},

   abstract = {More frequent high pressure conditions associated with atmospheric blocking episodes over Greenland in recent decades have been suggested to enhance melt through large-scale subsidence and cloud dissipation, which allows more solar radiation to reach the ice sheet surface. Here we investigate mechanisms linking high pressure circulation anomalies to Greenland cloud changes and resulting cloud radiative effects, with a focus on the previously neglected role of topography. Using reanalysis and satellite data in addition to a regional climate model, we show that anticyclonic circulation anomalies over Greenland during recent extreme blocking summers produce cloud changes dependent on orographic lift and descent. The resulting increased cloud cover over northern Greenland promotes surface longwave warming, while reduced cloud cover in southern and marginal Greenland favors surface shortwave warming. Comparison with an idealized model simulation with flattened topography reveals that orographic effects were necessary to produce area-averaged decreasing cloud cover since the mid-1990s and the extreme melt observed in the summer of 2012. This demonstrates a key role for Greenland topography in mediating the cloud and melt response to large-scale circulation variability. These results suggest that future melt will depend on the pattern of circulation anomalies as well as the shape of the Greenland Ice Sheet.},

Since surface-based observations are sparse in the Arctic, the accuracy of including reanalyses for spatial context is assessed. First, the DLW at Summit is reported, including the significant time scales of variability using time-frequency decomposition (wavelet analysis). A new method for evaluating reanalyses is then introduced that also uses wavelet analysis. ERA-Interim DLW performs reasonably well at Summit, but because it includes too many thin clouds and too few thick clouds, it is biased low overall. The correlation between the observations and ERA-Interim drops from r2 > 0.8 to near 0 for time series reconstructed from time scales less than ~4 days. These low correlations and additional analyses suggest that the spatial resolution of the data sets is a factor in representing variability on short time scales. The bias is low across all time scales and is thus likely tied to cloud generation processes in the model rather than the spatial representation of the atmosphere across the GrIS. The exception is autumn, when ERA-Interim overestimates the influence of clouds at time scales of 1 and 4 weeks. The spatial distribution of cloud influence on the DLW across the GrIS indicates that Summit is located in a transition zone with respect to cloud properties. The gradient across this transition zone is steepest near Summit in autumn, so the spatial characteristics of the atmosphere near Summit may contribute to the ERA-Interim bias during this time.},

   abstract = {Clouds and blocking activity have been implicated as causes of increased Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) melt in the 21st century. Although Greenland blocks (i.e., long-lasting, mostly stationary anticyclones) generally reduce cloud cover and move warm air over Greenland, the elevated GrIS perturbs air and moisture transport in complex ways, implying a need to better understand how blocks affect cloud and surface energy flux anomaly patterns. In this study, we use a combination of daily MODIS cloud data and meteorological and energy flux data from MERRA-2 reanalysis to better understand how Greenland block location, separated into four equal-area quadrants, affects regional cloud and surface energy flux spatial patterns in the summer months of 2002–2018. Overall, cloud fraction and cloud water path reductions are approximately four times greater during northern block days than southern block days. Net cloud radiative forcing anomalies are negative for all Greenland block locations because negative longwave cloud radiative forcing anomalies exceed positive shortwave cloud radiative forcing changes. However, greater cloud cover reductions during northern block days produce more negative net cloud radiative forcing anomalies than southern block days. Greenland-average (i.e., latitude-weighted average of all GrIS grids) net surface energy flux anomalies range from +7 to +12W/m2 for all block quadrants. While net shortwave energy anomalies dominate the total surface energy response during western Greenland block days, sensible heating is responsible for approximately half of positive total surface energy change during eastern Greenland block days.},

Nearly three years of data (January 2011-October 2013) are used to characterize the annual cycle of surface radiative fluxes and cloud radiative forcing (CRF) from the central Greenland Ice Sheet at Summit Station. The annual average CRF is 33 Wm-2, representing a substantial net cloud warming of the central Greenland surface. Unlike at other Arctic sites, clouds warm the surface during the summer. The surface albedo is high at Summit throughout the year, limiting the cooling effect of the shortwave CRF and thus the total CRF is dominated by cloud longwave warming effects in all months. All monthly mean CRF values are positive (warming), as are 98.5% of 3-hourly cases. The annual cycle of CRF is largely driven by the occurrence of liquid-bearing clouds, with a minimum in spring and maximum in late summer. Optically thick liquid-bearing clouds [liquid water path (LWP)> 30 gm-2] produce an average longwave CRF of 85 Wm-2. Shortwave CRF is sensitive to solar zenith angle and LWP. When the sun is well above the horizon (solar zenith angle < 65°), a maximum cloud surface warming occurs in the presence of optically thin liquid-bearing clouds. Ice clouds occur frequently above Summit and have mean longwave CRF values ranging from 10 to 60 Wm-2, dependent on cloud thickness.},

The results describe in detail how southerly, northerly, and zonal circulation regimes impact observations at Summit Station, Greenland. This southerly regime is linked to large anomalous increases in low-level liquid cloud formation, cloud radiative forcing (CRF), and surface warming at Summit Station. An individual southerly pattern relates to the largest positive anomalies, with the most extreme 25% of cases leading to CRF anomalies above 21Wm-2 and temperature anomalies beyond 8.5°C. Finally, the July 2012 extreme melt event is analyzed, showing that the prolonged ice sheet warming was related to persistence of these southerly circulation patterns, causing an unusually extended period of anomalous CRF and temperature.

During the passage through the aquifers, the isotope composition of water is essentially a conservative property at ambient temperatures, but at elevated temperatures, interaction with the rock matrix may perturb the isotope composition.

These changes have been linked to isotopic exchange with atmospheric water vapor and sublimation-induced fractionation, but the processes are poorly constrained by observations. Understanding and quantifying these processes are crucial to both the interpretation of ice core climate proxies and the formulation of isotope-enabled general circulation models. Here, we present continuous measurements of the water isotopic composition in surface snow and atmospheric vapor together with near-surface atmospheric turbulence and snow-air latent and sensible heat fluxes, obtained at the East Greenland Ice-Core Project drilling site in summer 2016. For two 4-day-long time periods, significant diurnal variations in atmospheric water isotopologues are observed. A model is developed to explore the impact of this variability on the surface snow isotopic composition. Our model suggests that the snow isotopic composition in the upper subcentimeter of the snow exhibits a diurnal variation with amplitudes in δ18O and δD of ~2.5‰ and ~13‰, respectively. As comparison, such changes correspond to 10–20% of the magnitude of seasonal changes in interior Greenland snow pack isotopes and of the change across a glacial-interglacial transition. Importantly, our observation and model results suggest, that sublimation-induced fractionation needs to be included in simulations of exchanges between the vapor and the snow surface on diurnal timescales during summer cloud-free conditions in northeast Greenland.},

   abstract = {Water isotopes are commonly used for climate reconstruction from ice cores. The different heavy isotopes of water such as H218O, H217O or HDO give information about local temperature but also temperature and humidity of water vapour sources. Quantification of these parameters relies on the good knowledge of equilibrium and kinetic isotopic fractionation at each step of the water cycle. One of the strongest limitations when interpreting water isotopes in remote Antarctic ice cores is the formulation of the isotopic fractionation at solid condensation (vapour to ice). This classical formulation also implies a good knowledge of coefficients for equilibrium fractionation and water vapour diffusion in air as well as supersaturation in clouds. The uncertainties associated with these different parameters make the formulation of isotopic fractionation at solid condensation only empirical.Here, we make use (1) of recent development in the measurements of water isotopes in the water vapour through infra-red spectroscopy and (2) of the possibility to measure accurately 17O-excess of water to test the classical formulation and parameterization of isotopic fractionation at solid condensation. A first experiment involving very strong supersaturation evidences a strong kinetic effect on 17O-excess at solid condensation, similar to d-excess. It also shows the limits of the classical formulation of water isotopic fractionation during solid condensation estimation at very low temperature. A second experiment performed in a cloud chamber under controlled conditions uses cavity ring down spectrometers (CRDS) to determine the spatial variability of water vapour isotopic composition due to diffusion (kinetic effect) during solid condensation. The spatial variability of water vapour isotopic composition can be relatively well reproduced by the resolution of diffusion toward a cold plate. This preliminary study opens new perspectives to revisit the classical formulation of water isotopic fractionation during solid condensation at very low temperature.},

The total construction cost for this rover is less than USD&thinsp;3000, approximately one-tenth the cost of existing platforms, and it can be built using facilities frequently available at academic institutions (machine shop, 3-D printer, open-source hardware and software). Instrumentation deployed on this rover can be customized; the rover presented in this study was equipped with a dual-frequency GPS receiver and a digital SLR camera for constructing digital elevation models using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We deployed this prototype rover on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to map local variations in snow accumulation and surface topography. The rover conducted four autonomous missions based out of the East Greenland Ice-Core Project (EastGRIP) camp during July 2017, measuring surface elevation transects across the hazardous ice-stream shear margins. During these missions, the rover proved capable of driving over 20km on a single charge with a drawbar pull of 250N, sufficient to tow instrumentation of up to 100kg. The rover also acquired photographs that were subsequently used to construct digital elevation models of a site monitored for spatiotemporal variability in snow accumulation, demonstrating adequate stability for high-resolution imaging applications. Due to its low cost, low-power requirements, and simple modular design, mass deployments of this rover design are practicable. Operation of the rover in hazardous areas circumvents the substantial expense and risk to personnel associated with conventional, crewed deployments. Thus, this rover is an investigatory platform that enables direct exploration of polar environments considered too hazardous for conventional field expeditions.},

On the occasion of the four decades of its successful applications to isotope geochemistry and hydrology, an attempt is made to: (a) examine its physical background within the framework of modern evaporation models, (b) evaluate our current knowledge of the environmental parameters of the C-G model, and (c) comment on a general strategy for the use of these parameters in field applications. Despite its simplistic representation of evaporation processes at the water-air interface, the C-G model appears to be adequate to provide the isotopic composition of the evaporation flux. This is largely due to its nature for representing isotopic compositions (a ratio of two fluxes of different isotopic water molecules) under the same environmental conditions. Among many environmental parameters that are included in the C-G model, accurate description and calculations are still problematic of the kinetic isotope effects that occur in a diffusion-dominated thin layer of air next to the water-air interface. In field applications, it is of importance to accurately evaluate several environmental parameters, particularly the relative humidity and isotopic compositions of the 'free-atmosphere', for a system under investigation over a given time-scale of interest (e.g., hourly to daily to seasonally). With a growing interest in the studies of water cycles of different spatial and temporal scales, including paleoclimate and water resource studies, the importance and utility of the C-G model is also likely to grow in the future.},

Measuring and comparing natural isotopic variations requires reliable primary reference materials and consistent data treatment. However, these reference materials have changed over time, while advances in technology have led to better constrained isotopic compositions of the reference materials. In this Technical Review, we provide an overview of the historical evolution of such materials, and explain their relationships across time and isotopic scales. Recommendations are provided for the measurement and reporting of isotopic compositions against the consensual VPDB and VSMOW scales in light of the newest carbonate and water reference materials distributed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Stable isotope fractionation factors and their temperature dependence in processes specific to the water cycle (2H, 18O, 17O) and the CO2–water–carbonate system (13C, 18O) are described, including for carbonate clumped isotope thermometry. Propagation of errors is also addressed for a consistent reporting of real uncertainties of isotopic measurements and calculations. Lastly, current gaps in knowledge on the behaviour of stable isotopes in the water cycle and the CO2–water–carbonate system are highlighted for future studies.},

   abstract = {Vapor transport in snow and firn plays a key role in post-depositional changes of many reactive species, in mass and energy balance of large snow-covered areas, and in metamorphic changes of the crystal structure of the snow itself. While conventional estimates of vapor transport and sublimation rate are based on diffusion of water vapor from the snow surface to the atmosphere, ventilation (airflow through interstitial pore spaces) in snow and firn can affect the top several meters of firn, yet the effects of ventilation on sublimation rates in firn have not been previously investigated. In this paper we present the first calculations of sublimation rates due to advective/diffusive airflow and vapor transport in the snow and firn. Airflow velocities, vapor transport and sublimation rates are calculated using a two-dimensional finite-element model. The airflow patterns induce regions of sublimation and regions of condensation within the snow and firn. Because small surface sastrugi move in time as the snow surface profile changes due to wind redeposition, the subsurface flow and regions of condensation and sublimation will also likely change on a time-scale of days to weeks. However, if the roughness features are such that they move very little over time, it is likely that the regions of condensation and sublimation will have a noticeable effect on the microstructure of the firn. While the highest mass-transfer rates occur near the surface, the depth of vapor transport and phase change depends on firn properties, wavelength of the snow surface roughness, and temperature.},

   abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the processes that couple the lower atmosphere to the upper surface of ice sheets is necessary for interpreting ice-core records. Of special interest are those processes that involve the exchange of energy or atmospheric constituents. One such process, wind pumping, entails both possibilities and provides a possible mechanism for converting atmospheric kinetic energy into a near-surface heat source within the firn layer. The essential idea is that temporal and spatial variations in surface air pressure, resulting from air motion, can diffuse into permeable firn by conventional Darcy flow. Viscous friction between moving air and the solid firn matrix leads to energy dissipation in the firn that is equivalent to a volumetric heat source.Initial theoretical work on wind pumping was aimed at explaining anomalous near-surface temperatures measured at sites on Agassiz Ice Cap, Arctic Canada. A conclusion of this preliminary work was that, under highly favourable conditions, anomalous warming of as much as 2°C was possible. Subsequent efforts to confirm wind-pumping predictions suggest that our initial estimates of the penetration depth for pressure fluctuations were optimistic. These observations point to a deficiency of the initial theoretical formulation — the surface-pressure forcing was assumed to vary temporally, but not spatially. Thus, within the firn there was only a surface-normal component of air flow. The purpose of the present contribution is to advance a three-dimensional theory of wind pumping in which air flow is driven by both spatial and temporal fluctuations in surface pressure. Conclusions of the three-dimensional analysis are that the penetration of pressure fluctuations, and hence the thickness of the zone of frictional interaction between air and permeable firn, is related to both the frequency of the pressure fluctuations and to the spatial coherence length of turbulence cells near the firn surface.},

Topographical features of shorter wavelengths produce stronger surface flows, but the flow decays rapidly with depth. Longer-wavelength features produce weaker surface flows but the flow decays more slowly with depth. The flow may only be strong enough to disrupt the temperaure field for features of wavelengths on the scale of meters or tens of meters at wind speeds of 10 m/s or more. Other possible causes of windpumping do not appear to be significant. Rapid pressure perturbations due to turbulence produce very little displacement of the air because of the high frequency and low amplitude. Barometric pressure changes cause compression and expansion of the air in the pore space, but the rate is too low to have much effect. -Author},

The horizontal and total fluxes are high in hoar layers but the pressure perturbations and vertical components of the flow do not penetrate as deeply as in homogeneous snow. That is because the layers “pipe” the flow horizontally toward the area of low pressure. An ice layer at the surface reduces the total flow everywhere. The flow decreases as ice-layer thickness increases and, in general, flow changes with permeability. However, the magnitude of the effect is proportionately weaker when the ice layers are further from the surface. The residence time is reduced when hoar layers are present due to shorter flow paths, reduced penetration into the deeper snow and higher speeds.},

   abstract = {The prediction of future greenhouse-gas-induced warming depends critically on the sensitivity of Earth's climate to increasing atmospheric concentrations of these gases. Data from cores drilled in polar ice sheets show a remarkable correlation between past glacial-interglacial temperature changes and the inferred atmospheric concentration of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. These and other palaeoclimate data are used to assess the role of greenhouse gases in explaining past global climate change, and the validity of models predicting the effect of increasing concentrations of such gases in the atmosphere. INFRARED-ABSORBING gases in the Earth's atmosphere raise the mean global surface temperature from-18 OC, which it would be in the absence of an atmosphere, to-15 °C. This trapping of infrared energy emitted by the Earth's surface is known as the greenhouse effece-4 • The largest effect is from water vapour, with a significant contribution from carbon dioxide and smaller contributions from ozone, methane, nitrous oxide and, in the past few decades, anthropogenic chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs). The naturally occurring greenhouse effect makes our planet habitable, but there is growing concern about the future of the Earth's climate because of increasing atmospheric concentrations of C0 2 , CH 4 , N 2 0 and CFCs, which are largely a result of man's activities. This radiative forcing (the change of the planetary radiation balance) is just over 4 W m-2 for a doubling of the C0 2 concentration (from, say, 300 to 600 p.p.m.v.). The increase in atmospheric C0 2 , CH 4 , N 2 0 and CFCs that have occurred since the beginning of the industrial revolution results in a forcing of just over 2 W m-z (ref. 5); thus the anthropogenic greenhouse forcing has already reached a level of about half of the doubled-C0 2 radiative forcing, the canonical large forcing used in theoretical climate studies. The radiative forcing resulting from doubled atmospheric C0 2 would increase the surface and tropospheric temperature by 11 Te = 1.2 oc if there were no feedbacks in the climate system (see Box 1). But there are many possible feedbacks which may occur in response to an initial forcing. For example, a warming climate is likely to alter the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, the cloud properties, snow cover and sea ice 1-4 • 6 • Doubled-C0 2 sensitivity experiments using the most comprehensive climate models, the three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs), yield equilibrium warmings between 1.9 and 5.2 oc 6-11. The uncertainty in climate sensitivity obtained from GCMs may, however, be even greater than this. A recent comparison of 14 GCMs showed about a threefold variation in climate sensitivity, attributable mainly to differences in the cloud feedbacks 12. Some simple one-dimensional climate models suggest essentially no net feedback 3. Thus the net feedback factor f (the amplification of the no-feedback radiative-equilibrium temperature change) is uncertain in the large range f = 1-4 (Box 1). One implication of the uncertainty in climate sensitivity is an even greater uncertainty in the climate response time. The time required for the climate system to approach a new equilibrium temperature after a change of radiative forcing varies at least linearly with / 6 • 13 because the feedbacks come into play in response to the change of temperature, not in response to the climate forcing. A consequence of the large uncertainty in the response time, which may be anywhere from a decade to more than a century, is that the observed global temperature trend of NATURE · VOL 34 7 · 13 SEPTEMBER 1990 the past century does not provide a very stringent empirical limit on climate sensitivity; indeed, allowing for the possibility of small unknown climate forcings, such as changes of tropo-spheric aerosols and solar irradiance, and for unforced climate variability, the temperature trend of the past century does not provide a useful bound on climate sensitivity 6 • 14 • 15. A more promising source of empirical information on global climate sensitivity is provided by the changes in Earth's climate during the past few hundred thousand years because the global temperature change was very large,-4-5 °C 16 ' 17 , the climate change was linked with changes of greenhouse-gas concentration (which by themselves resulted in a direct radiative forcing of-2 W m-2) and the changes were maintained for a sufficiently long time for equilibrium to be achieved, unlike the present greenhouse-gas changes. Based on these considerations there have already been attempts 6 • 19 to estimate climate sensitivity from conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum, 18,000 years before present (18 kyr BP). Box 1 Equilibrium temperature, feedback processes and 2 x C0 2 experiments Earth's atmosphere is heated by short-wavelength solar radiation and cooled by the emission of long-wavelength radiation to space. The planetary radiative energy budget per unit area, N, can be written as the difference of these terms 1-a N=-SeaT 4 4 s (1) where S is the solar constant (1,370 W m-2), a the planetary reflec-tivity or albedo (0.3), e the effective emissivity of the atmosphere, a the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and r. the surface temperature 65.

The time evolution of these properties, as well as their anisotropy coefficients, was investigated, showing the development of a strong anisotropic behavior during the experiment. Most of the computed physical properties of snow were then compared with two analytical estimates (self-consistent estimates and dilute beds of spheroids) based on the snow density, and the size and anisotropy of the microstructure through the correlation lengths. These models, which require only basic microstructural information, offer rather good estimates of the properties and anisotropy coefficients for our experiment without any fitting parameters. Our results highlight the interplay between the microstructure and physical properties, showing that the physical properties of snow subjected to a temperature isotropic parameters such as the density and require more refined information. Furthermore, this study constitutes a detailed database on the evolution of snow properties under a temperature gradient, which can be used as a guideline and a validation tool for snow metamorphism models at the microor macroscale.},

However, the exact quantitative interpretation of these important climate proxy records in terms of surface temperature, ice sheet height and other climatic changes is still a matter of debate. Here we report results obtained with an atmospheric general circulation model equipped with water isotopes, run at a high-spatial horizontal resolution of one-by-one degree. Comparing different glacial maximum ice sheet reconstructions, a best model data match is achieved for the PMIP3 reconstruction. Reduced West Antarctic elevation changes between 400 and 800 m lead to further improved agreement with ice core data. Our modern and glacial climate simulations support the validity of the isotopic paleothermometer approach based on the use of present-day observations and reveal that a glacial ocean state as displayed in the GLAMAP reconstruction is suitable for capturing the observed glacial isotope changes in Antarctic ice cores.},

   abstract = {Ice core records are often affected by post-depositional processes that need to be better understood to prevent wrong interpretation of the data. Records of stable isotopes are affected by diffusion both in the firn and in the deeper ice. We present a quantitative theory for diffusion in firn that applies the measured tortuosity factors for O 2 and CO 2 in fim to the diffusing water vapor. Because of different fractionation factors, the theory predicts stronger smoothing for 8 8 0 than for bD, in excellent agreement with our data. This effect opens up the possibility for using detailed isotope records to estimate paleotemperatures in deeper strata. We show that this differential smoothing can create an artificial annual cycle in deuterium excess, which was not present at the time of deposition. It also increases the slope observed in high resolution data series between bD and 8 8 0 variations. For the annual cycles, we observe that this slope can increase from 8 at the surface up to II in deeper firn. In the Holocene ice for the GRIP core, we observe much stronger smoothing than predicted from diffusion in solid ice; this suggests an anomalous diffusion process in glacier ice. Possible models for this excess diffusion are discussed i.a., in terms of the thickness of water films on grain boundaries and in veins.},

The relation between the isotopic composition and various synoptic parameters is discussed. Based on “deuterium excess” values, the rain samples can be separated into three groups. The majority of the samples have a “deuterium excess” between 10 and 22‰. These samples have different histories from the meteorological point of view. However, there are two extreme groups, one has “deuterium excess” values above 22‰ and the other has values less than 10‰. It was found that the rains which are most depleted with regard to deuterium and with the lowest “deuterium excess” values are associated with air masses that reach the region concerned from the southwest. Rains with a “deuterium excess” of more than 22‰ are associated with air masses which come mainly from northeastern Europe and reach the considered region from west to northwest, following intense interaction with the central-eastern Mediterranean Sea. © 1983, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V..

We show that VPD during fruit development is a key indicator of global coffee productivity, with yield declining rapidly above 0.82 kPa. The risk of exceeding this threshold rises sharply for most countries we assess, if global warming exceeds 2 °C. At 2.9 °C, countries making up 90% of global supply are more likely than not to exceed the VPD threshold.

   abstract = {The most recent glacial to interglacial transition constitutes a remarkable natural experiment for learning how Earth's climate responds to various forcings, including a rise in atmospheric CO2. This transition has left a direct thermal remnant in the polar ice sheets, where the exceptional purity and continual accumulation of ice permit analyses not possible in other settings. For Antarctica, the deglacial warming has previously been constrained only by the water isotopic composition in ice cores, without an absolute thermometric assessment of the isotopes' sensitivity to temperature. To overcome this limitation, we measured temperatures in a deep borehole and analyzed them together with ice-core data to reconstruct the surface temperature history of West Antarctica. The deglacial warming was 11:31:8 C, approximately two to three times the global average, in agreement with theoretical expectations for Antarctic amplification of planetary temperature changes. Consistent with evidence from glacier retreat in Southern Hemisphere mountain ranges, the Antarctic warming was mostly completed by 15 kyBP, several millennia earlier than in the Northern Hemisphere. These results constrain the role of variable oceanic heat transport between hemispheres during deglaciation and quantitatively bound the direct influence of global climate forcings on Antarctic temperature. Although climate models perform well on average in this context, some recent syntheses of deglacial climate history have underestimated Antarctic warming and the models with lowest sensitivity can be discounted.},

   abstract = {The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of ice cores from Summit, Greenland, has provided invaluable information about variations in past climate. However, interpretations of these isotopic data have been made despite a paucity of direct isotopic studies of Summit precipitation. We provide insight to such interpretations by examining the annual cycle of deuterium excess (d-excess) in precipitation samples from Summit and by considering the climatic controls on the annual cycle. Precipitation was collected daily from July 2011 to September 2014 at heights of 1, 2, and 4 m. The isotopic composition of precipitation sampled at 4 m above the snow surface is free of contamination from blowing snow. Precipitation d-excess is high in the summer and low in the winter, a pattern opposite to that found at most high-latitude locations, where summer d-excess is low relative to winter. Low winter d-excess values at Summit can be explained by varying degrees of Rayleigh distillation of moisture sourced from isotopically similar marine sources. However, the observed summer d-excess maximum at Summit is anomalously high compared with other Arctic locations, and we propose that this is due to high d-excess moisture contributed by sublimation of surface snow on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We demonstrate the plausibility of this hypothesis through simple isotopic mass balance calculations, analyses of cloud heights, and back trajectories to identify moisture sources. We show that Rayleigh distillation, sublimation, and the phase of the d-excess annual cycle are all important factors that should be considered in ice core d-excess interpretations.},

   abstract = {Stable water isotopes from polar ice cores are invaluable high-resolution climate proxy records. Recent studies have aimed to improve knowledge of how the climate signal is stored in the water isotope record by addressing the influence of post-depositional processes on the surface snow isotopic composition. In this study, the relationship between changes in surface snow microstructure after precipitation/deposition events and water isotopes is explored using measurements of snow specific 5 surface area (SSA). Continuous daily SSA measurements from the East Greenland Ice Core Project site (EastGRIP) situated in the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the summer seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019 are used to develop an empirical decay model to describe events of rapid decrease in SSA, driven predominantly by vapour diffusion in the pore space and atmospheric vapour exchange. The SSA decay model is described by the exponential equation SSA(t) = (SSA 0 − 26.8) e −0.54 t + 26.8. The model performance is optimal for daily mean values of surface temperature in the range 0 • C to-25 • C 10 and wind speed < 6 m s −1. The findings from the SSA analysis are used to explore the influence of surface snow metamorphism on altering the isotopic composition of surface snow. It is found that rapid SSA decay events correspond to decreases in d-excess over a 2-day period in 72 % of the samples. Detailed studies using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis revealed a coherence between the dominant mode of variance of SSA and d-excess during periods of low spatial variability of surface snow over the sampling transect, suggesting that processes driving change in SSA also influence d-excess. Our findings 15 highlight the need for future studies to decouple the processes driving surface snow metamorphism in order to quantify the fractionation effect of individual processes on the snow isotopic composition.},

   abstract = {A single isotope ratio (δD or δ18O) of water is widely used as an air-temperature proxy in Antarctic ice core records. These isotope ratios, however, do not solely depend on air-temperature but also on the extent of distillation of heavy isotopes out of atmospheric water vapor from an oceanic moisture source to a precipitation site. The temperature changes at the oceanic moisture source (ΔTsource) and at the precipitation site (ΔTsite) can be retrieved by using deuterium-excess (d) data. A new d record from Dome Fuji, Antarctica spanning the past 360 000 yr is presented and compared with records from Vostok and EPICA Dome C ice cores. In previous studies, to retrieve ΔTsource and ΔT site information, different linear regression equations were proposed using theoretical isotope distillation models. A major source of uncertainty lies in the coefficient of regression, βsite which is related to the sensitivity of d to ΔTsite. We show that different ranges of temperature and selections of isotopic model outputs may increase the value of βsite by more than a factor of two. To explore the impacts of this coefficient on reconstructed temperatures, we apply for the first time the exact same methodology to the isotope records from the three Antarctica ice cores. We show that uncertainties in the βsite coefficient strongly affect (i) the glacial-interglacial magnitude of ΔTsource; (ii) the imprint of obliquity in ΔTsource and in the site-source temperature gradient. By contrast, we highlight the robustness of ΔT site reconstruction using water isotopes records. © 2012 Author(s). CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

Stable-isotope ratios of ice are widely used as a palaeothermometer, an interpretation backed by well-established theory. In contrast, the interpretation of aerosols such as mineral dust and sea salts has remained a topic of debate. Here, we demonstrate that both the fractionation of water isotopes and the scavenging of aerosols are fundamentally driven by the same process, the condensation of water from the atmosphere. Water isotope ratios and aerosol concentrations in ice cores are remarkably coherent on all timescales longer than a few centuries. This shared low-frequency variability is dominated by the essential physics of the hydrologic cycle, which also accounts for the difference in variability between marine- and terrestrial-sourced aerosols in ice cores, as well as the global spatial pattern of aerosol changes recorded in both marine sediments and ice. These results have implications for past changes in radiative forcing and other fundamental aspects of climate, such as polar amplification, which are imprinted on the relationships between these proxy records.},

   abstract = {Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) has previously been measured in ice cores in Antarctica as a proxy for sea ice extent and Southern Hemisphere circulation. In a series of chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) sensitivity experiments, we identify mechanisms that control the MSA concentrations recorded in ice cores. Sea ice is linked to MSA via dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is produced biologically in the surface ocean and known to be particularly concentrated in the sea ice zone. Given existing ocean surface DMS concentration data sets, the model does not demonstrate a strong relationship between sea ice and MSA deposition in Antarctica. The variability of DMS emissions associated with sea ice extent is small (11-30%) due to the small interannual variability of sea ice extent. Wind plays a role in the variability in DMS emissions, but its contribution relative to that of sea ice is strongly dependent on the assumed DMS concentrations in the sea ice zone. Atmospheric sulfur emitted as DMS from the sea ice undergoes net transport northward. Our model runs suggest that DMS emissions from the sea ice zone may account for 26-62% of MSA deposition at the Antarctic coast and 36-95% in inland Antarctica. Though our results are sensitive to model assumptions, it is clear that an improved understanding of both DMS concentrations and emissions from the sea ice zone are required to better assess the impact of sea ice variability on MSA deposition to Antarctica.

A negative temporal trend in accumulation rates is unexpected in light of rising surface temperatures as well as model simulations predicting higher accumulation rates for the region. Both the magnitude of the mean accumulation rates and the range of interannual variability observed in the new records compare favorably to older records collected from a broad area of the WAIS, suggesting that the new data may serve as a regional proxy for recent temporal trends in West Antarctic accumulation rates. The observed negative trend in accumulation is likely the result of a shift in low-pressure systems over the Amundsen Sea region, dominated by changes in the austral fall season. Regional-scale climate models and reanalysis data do not capture the negative trend in accumulation rate observed in these firn cores. Nevertheless the models and reanalyses agree well in both accumulation-rate means and interannual variability, with no single model or dataset standing out as significantly more skilled at capturing the observed magnitude of and trend in accumulation rates in this region of the WAIS.

   abstract = {Fifty-four years of Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station meteorological data have been analyzed to develop a comprehensive climatology from the station's meteorological observations. In reaching the goal of a full climatological analysis, a meteorological station history was required and a full quality control review of the data was conducted. Analysis of the general fifty-year climate is presented for temperature, pressure, wind speed and wind direction along with averages (means), extremes and records, daily ranges, trends and discontinuities. Additional investigations include how often the temperature reaches -100°F and changes in the flying season as seen via acceptable temperatures. The analysis found slight decreases in the temperature and pressure over the 1957-2010 time period that are not statistically significant. The wind speed, however, does show a significant downward trend of 0.28ms -1decade -1 over the same period. The seasonal time series of temperature and pressure illustrate how longer term oscillations are superimposed on shorter-term fluctuations. The seasonal mean wind speed over the 54year period shows a consistent pattern of decreasing speed for all seasons. In contrast to the mean wind speeds, the maximum wind speeds are increasing for the summer and transition seasons, and the increases are statistically significant. Finally, for the period 1983-2010, the average annual snow accumulation is decreasing at a statistically significant downward rate of -2.9mmyear -1. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of ice cores from Summit, Greenland, has provided invaluable information about variations in past climate. However, interpretations of these isotopic data have been made despite a paucity of direct isotopic studies of Summit precipitation. We provide insight to such interpretations by examining the annual cycle of deuterium excess (d-excess) in precipitation samples from Summit and by considering the climatic controls on the annual cycle. Precipitation was collected daily from July 2011 to September 2014 at heights of 1, 2, and 4 m. The isotopic composition of precipitation sampled at 4 m above the snow surface is free of contamination from blowing snow. Precipitation d-excess is high in the summer and low in the winter, a pattern opposite to that found at most high-latitude locations, where summer d-excess is low relative to winter. Low winter d-excess values at Summit can be explained by varying degrees of Rayleigh distillation of moisture sourced from isotopically similar marine sources. However, the observed summer d-excess maximum at Summit is anomalously high compared with other Arctic locations, and we propose that this is due to high d-excess moisture contributed by sublimation of surface snow on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We demonstrate the plausibility of this hypothesis through simple isotopic mass balance calculations, analyses of cloud heights, and back trajectories to identify moisture sources. We show that Rayleigh distillation, sublimation, and the phase of the d-excess annual cycle are all important factors that should be considered in ice core d-excess interpretations.},

   abstract = {The most recent glacial to interglacial transition constitutes a remarkable natural experiment for learning how Earth's climate responds to various forcings, including a rise in atmospheric CO2. This transition has left a direct thermal remnant in the polar ice sheets, where the exceptional purity and continual accumulation of ice permit analyses not possible in other settings. For Antarctica, the deglacial warming has previously been constrained only by the water isotopic composition in ice cores, without an absolute thermometric assessment of the isotopes' sensitivity to temperature. To overcome this limitation, we measured temperatures in a deep borehole and analyzed them together with ice-core data to reconstruct the surface temperature history of West Antarctica. The deglacial warming was 11:31:8 C, approximately two to three times the global average, in agreement with theoretical expectations for Antarctic amplification of planetary temperature changes. Consistent with evidence from glacier retreat in Southern Hemisphere mountain ranges, the Antarctic warming was mostly completed by 15 kyBP, several millennia earlier than in the Northern Hemisphere. These results constrain the role of variable oceanic heat transport between hemispheres during deglaciation and quantitatively bound the direct influence of global climate forcings on Antarctic temperature. Although climate models perform well on average in this context, some recent syntheses of deglacial climate history have underestimated Antarctic warming and the models with lowest sensitivity can be discounted.},

   abstract = {The surface energy budget plays a critical role in determining the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet, which in turn has significant implications for global sea levels. Nearly three years of data (January 2011-October 2013) are used to characterize the annual cycle of surface radiative fluxes and cloud radiative forcing (CRF) from the central Greenland Ice Sheet at Summit Station. The annual average CRF is 33 Wm-2, representing a substantial net cloud warming of the central Greenland surface. Unlike at other Arctic sites, clouds warm the surface during the summer. The surface albedo is high at Summit throughout the year, limiting the cooling effect of the shortwave CRF and thus the total CRF is dominated by cloud longwave warming effects in all months. All monthly mean CRF values are positive (warming), as are 98.5% of 3-hourly cases. The annual cycle of CRF is largely driven by the occurrence of liquid-bearing clouds, with a minimum in spring and maximum in late summer. Optically thick liquid-bearing clouds [liquid water path (LWP)> 30 gm-2] produce an average longwave CRF of 85 Wm-2. Shortwave CRF is sensitive to solar zenith angle and LWP. When the sun is well above the horizon (solar zenith angle < 65°), a maximum cloud surface warming occurs in the presence of optically thin liquid-bearing clouds. Ice clouds occur frequently above Summit and have mean longwave CRF values ranging from 10 to 60 Wm-2, dependent on cloud thickness.},

   abstract = {Using lidar and radiative flux observations from space and ground, and a lidar simulator, we evaluate clouds simulated by climate models over the Greenland ice sheet, including predicted cloud cover, cloud fraction profile, cloud opacity, and surface cloud radiative effects. The representation of clouds over Greenland is a central concern for the models because clouds impact ice sheet surface melt. We find that over Greenland, most of the models have insufficient cloud cover during summer. In addition, all models create too few nonopaque, liquid-containing clouds optically thin enough to let direct solar radiation reach the surface (-1% to -3.5% at the ground level). Some models create too few opaque clouds. In most climate models, the cloud properties biases identified over all Greenland also apply at Summit, Greenland, proving the value of the ground observatory in model evaluation. At Summit, climate models underestimate cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the surface, especially in summer. The primary driver of the summer CRE biases compared to observations is the underestimation of the cloud cover in summer (-46% to -21%), which leads to an underestimated longwave radiative warming effect (CRELW = -35.7 to -13.6 W m-2 compared to the ground observations) and an underestimated shortwave cooling effect (CRESW = +1.5 to +10.5 W m-2 compared to the ground observations). Overall, the simulated clouds do not radiatively warm the surface as much as observed.},

This evaluation was conducted using a four-week 16 observation period from the Arctic Ocean 2018 expedition, where the transition from sea ice melting to freezing conditions 17 was measured. Three different cloud schemes were tested within a nested limited area model (LAM) configuration of the UM 18-two regionally-operational single-moment schemes (UM_RA2M and UM_RA2T), and one novel double-moment scheme 19 (UM_CASIM-100)-while one global simulation was conducted with the IFS, utilising its default cloud scheme 20 (ECMWF_IFS). 21 Consistent weaknesses were identified across both models, with both the UM and IFS overestimating cloud occurrence below 22 3 km. This overestimation was also consistent across the three cloud configurations used within the UM framework, with >90% 23 mean cloud occurrence simulated between 0.15 and 1 km in all model simulations. However, the cloud microphysical structure, 24 on average, was modelled reasonably well in each simulation, with the cloud liquid water content (í µí°¿í µí±í µí° ¶) and ice water content 25 (í µí°¼í µí±í µí° ¶) comparing well with observations over much of the vertical profile.

Both models also consistently exhibited temperature and moisture biases below 3 km, with particularly strong cold 31 biases coinciding with the overabundant modelled cloud layers.

   abstract = {We present here results of new isotope-enabled simulations with an enhanced ECHAM6-wiso model version nudged to the ERA5 reanalyses, at two different spatial resolutions, for the period 1979–2018. The isotopic content of snow on sea ice is considered, yielding surface water vapor with lower isotope ratios over sea ice covered areas, and the kinetic fractionation factors for oceanic evaporation are assumed as independent of wind speed. Also, the supersaturation equation was slightly re-tuned for a better agreement with the Antarctic isotope observations. In addition to the spatial resolution, the impacts of the improved ECHAM6 model physics and the chosen updated ERA5 reanalyses data set on our simulation results are investigated. For this purpose, detailed comparisons to simulation results obtained from the predecessor ECHAM5-wiso model nudged to ERA5 reanalyses and from ECHAM6-wiso nudged to ERA-Interim are performed. Compared to the ERA-Interim reanalyses, the nudging to ERA5 does not result in substantial changes of modeled surface isotope values on a global scale but water transport over the tropics clearly changed, with increased precipitation amounts over the Amazonian area and related changes of isotopic contents in water vapor in the high troposphere. An ECHAM6-wiso simulation at high spatial resolution (0.9° horizontal resolution and 95 vertical levels) generally further improves the modeling of annual mean isotope values. The modeling of temporal isotopic variations at seasonal and (sub-)daily time scales is also slightly improved for the high spatial resolution configuration. The latter will be very useful for an improved interpretation of various water isotope records.},

Analysing δ18O in two 50 m long snow trenches allowed us to create an unprecedented, two-dimensional image characterising the isotopic variations from the centimetre to the 100-metre scale. Our results show seasonal layering of the isotopic composition but also high horizontal isotopic variability caused by local stratigraphic noise. Based on the horizontal and vertical structure of the isotopic variations, we derive a statistical noise model which successfully explains the trench data.

   abstract = {Above polar ice sheets, atmospheric water vapor exchange occurs across the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and is an important mechanism in a number of processes that affect the surface mass balance of the ice sheets. Yet, this exchange is not well understood and has substantial implications for modeling and remote sensing of the polar hydrologic cycle. Efforts to characterize the exchange face substantial logistical challenges including the remoteness of ice sheet field camps, extreme weather conditions, low humidity and temperature that limit the effectiveness of instruments, and dangers associated with flying manned aircraft at low altitudes. Here, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sampling platform for operation in extreme polar environments that is capable of sampling atmospheric water vapor for subsequent measurement of water isotopes. This system was deployed to the East Greenland Ice-core Project (EastGRIP) camp in northeast Greenland during summer 2019. Four sampling flight missions were completed. With a suite of atmospheric measurements aboard the UAV (temperature, humidity, pressure, GPS) we determine the height of the PBL using online algorithms, allowing for strategic decision-making by the pilot to sample water isotopes above and below the PBL. Water isotope data were measured by a Picarro L2130-i instrument using flasks of atmospheric air collected within the nose cone of the UAV. The internal repeatability for δD and δ18O was 2.8 ‰ and 0.45 ‰, respectively, which we also compared to independent EastGRIP tower-isotope data. Based on these results, we demonstrate the efficacy of this new UAV-isotope platform and present improvements to be utilized in future polar field campaigns. The system is also designed to be readily adaptable to other fields of study, such as measurement of carbon cycle gases or remote sensing of ground conditions.},

   abstract = {As rapid warming of the Arctic occurs, it is imperative that climate indicators such as temperature be monitored over large areas to understand and predict the effects of climate changes. Temperatures are traditionally tracked using in situ 2 m air temperatures and can also be assessed using remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing is especially valuable over the Greenland Ice Sheet, where few ground-based air temperature measurements exist. Because of the presence of surface-based temperature inversions in ice-covered areas, differences between 2 m air temperature and the temperature of the actual snow surface (referred to as "skin" temperature) can be significant and are particularly relevant when considering validation and application of remote sensing temperature data. We present results from a field campaign extending from 8 June to 18 July 2015, near Summit Station in Greenland, to study surface temperature using the following measurements: skin temperature measured by an infrared (IR) sensor, 2 m air temperature measured by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) meteorological station, and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface temperature product. Our data indicate that 2 m air temperature is often significantly higher than snow skin temperature measured in situ, and this finding may account for apparent biases in previous studies of MODIS products that used 2 m air temperature for validation. This inversion is present during our study period when incoming solar radiation and wind speed are both low. As compared to our in situ IR skin temperature measurements, after additional cloud masking, the MOD/MYD11 Collection 6 surface temperature standard product has an RMSE of 1.0 °C and a mean bias of -0.4 °C, spanning a range of temperatures from -35 to -5 °C (RMSE Combining double low line 1.6 °C and mean bias Combining double low line -0.7 °C prior to cloud masking). For our study area and time series, MODIS surface temperature products agree with skin surface temperatures better than previous studies indicated, especially at temperatures below -20 °C, where other studies found a significant cold bias. We show that the apparent cold bias present in other comparisons of 2 m air temperature and MODIS surface temperature may be a result of the near-surface temperature inversion. Further investigation of how in situ IR skin temperatures compare to MODIS surface temperature at lower temperatures (below -35 °C) is warranted to determine whether a cold bias exists for those temperatures.},

   abstract = {We present temperature inversion characteristics during fog and nonfog conditions at three east Greenland coastal weather stations during Arctic melt seasons 1980–2016. For this purpose, we developed a novel automated method to extract fog-top height (FTH) from Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive data, which is applicable to any fog thermodynamic profile and includes an improved interpolation of saturation between sounding levels. From the analysis of >22,000 melt-season soundings we conclude that inversions occur 85–95% of the time, are predominantly elevated, and have median depths >200 m. Fog at high-Arctic locations often penetrates the inversion layer, especially in the late melt season, and is commonly several hundred meters thick. At low-Arctic locations fog is thinner and generally restricted to the mixed layer. Inversions during fog are deeper and stronger compared to nonfog conditions. This effect is more pronounced at higher latitudes, which we attribute to distinct local boundary layer conditions and large-scale processes. The Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive-extracted FTHs have a cumulative error of 56 m and are in reasonable agreement with retrievals from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation satellite cloud top data. The novel FTH extraction method can be applied to any polar sounding with >5 significant levels below 700 hPa and can be extended to boundary layer clouds other than fog, which represent the majority of cloud occurrence in the Arctic melt season. This study advances the understanding of interactions between low clouds and temperature inversions and improves retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness from radiosondes: both have important implications for the Arctic surface energy budget.},

The present study quantifies the temporal and spatial variability of surface-based inversions (SBIs) and elevated inversions (EIs) over Greenland, as derived from the ERA-Interim (ERA-I) dataset for the period 1979-2017. The seasonal and multiannual variability of inversion strength, thickness, and frequency are examined. Our results clearly show regional as well as seasonal patterns of both SBIs and EIs. SBIs are more frequent and stronger than EIs, and the spatial variability of inversions is larger during winter and smaller during summer. Furthermore, during summer, there has been a trend toward stronger (0.3 K decade 21), thicker (12 m decade 21), and more frequent (3% decade 21) SBIs in the southern part of Greenland, especially in the past two decades. Evidently, the strengthening of the anticyclone over Greenland causes a reduction of cloud cover, which manifests in an increase in SBI strength and thickness, particularly in the southern part of Greenland.},

   abstract = {Snowfall is the major source of mass for the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) but the spatial and temporal variability of snowfall and the connections between snowfall and mass balance have so far been inadequately quantified. By characterizing local atmospheric circulation and utilizing CloudSat spaceborne radar observations of snowfall, we provide a detailed spatial analysis of snowfall variability and its relationship to Greenland mass balance, presenting first-of-their-kind maps of daily spatial variability in snowfall from observations across Greenland. For identified regional atmospheric circulation patterns, we show that the spatial distribution and net mass input of snowfall vary significantly with the position and strength of surface cyclones. Cyclones west of Greenland driving southerly flow contribute significantly more snowfall than any other circulation regime, with each daily occurrence of the most extreme southerly circulation pattern contributing an average of 1.66 Gt of snow to the Greenland ice sheet. While cyclones east of Greenland, patterns with the least snowfall, contribute as little as 0.58 Gt each day. Above 2 km on the ice sheet where snowfall is inconsistent, extreme southerly patterns are the most significant mass contributors, with up to 1.20 Gt of snowfall above this elevation. This analysis demonstrates that snowfall over the interior of Greenland varies by up to a factor of 5 depending on regional circulation conditions. Using independent observations of mass changes made by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we verify that the largest mass increases are tied to the southerly regime with cyclones west of Greenland. For occurrences of the strongest southerly pattern, GRACE indicates a net mass increase of 1.29 Gt in the ice sheet accumulation zone (above 2 km elevation) compared to the 1.20 Gt of snowfall observed by CloudSat. This overall agreement suggests that the analytical approach presented here can be used to directly quantify snowfall mass contributions and their most significant drivers spatially across the GrIS. While previous research has implicated this same southerly regime in ablation processes during summer, this paper shows that ablation mass loss in this circulation regime is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the mass gain from associated snowfall. For daily occurrences of the southerly circulation regime, a mass loss of approximately 11 Gt is observed across the ice sheet despite snowfall mass input exceeding 1 Gt. By analyzing the spatial variability of snowfall and mass changes, this research provides new insight into connections between regional atmospheric circulation and GrIS mass balance. Copyright:},

   abstract = {On the Antarctic plateau, precipitation quantities are so low that the surface mass budget is for an important part determined by exchanges of water vapor between the snow surface and the atmosphere surface. At Dome C (75° S, 123° E), we have frequently observed the growth of crystals on the snow surface under calm sunny weather. Here we present the time variations of specific surface area (SSA) and density of these crystals. Using the detailed snow model Crocus, we conclude that the formation of these crystals was very likely due to the nighttime formation of surface hoar crystals and to the daytime formation of sublimation crystals. These latter crystals form by processes similar to those involved in the formation of frost flowers on young sea ice. The formation of these crystals impacts the albedo, mass and energy budget of the Antarctic plateau. In particular, the SSA variations of the surface layer can induce an instantaneous forcing at the snow surface up to g-10 W m-2 at noon, resulting in a surface temperature drop of 0.45 K. This result confirms that snow SSA is a crucial variable to consider in the energy budget and climate of snow-covered surfaces. © 2014 Author(s).},

   abstract = {Snow at or close to the surface commonly undergoes temperature gradient metamorphism under advective flow, which alters its microstructure and physical properties. A functional understanding of this process is essential for many disciplines, from modeling the effects of snow on regional and global climate to assessing avalanche formation. Time-lapse X-ray microtomography was applied to investigate the structural dynamics of temperature gradient snow metamorphism exposed to an advective airflow in controlled laboratory conditions. Experiments specifically analyzed sublimation and deposition of water vapor on the ice structure. In addition, an analysis of the ice-air interface dynamics was carried out using a macroscopic equivalent model of heat and water vapor transport through a snow layer. The results indicate that sublimation of the ice matrix dominated for flow rates < 10-6 m3 s-1 while during increased mass flow rates the water vapor deposition supplied by the advective flow counteracted sublimation. A flow rate dependence of water vapor deposition at the ice interface was observed, asymptotically approaching an average estimated maximum deposition rate on the whole sample of 1.05 · 10-4 kg m-3 s-1. The growth of microsized whisker-like crystals on larger ice crystals was detected on microscope photographs, leading to an increase of the specific surface area and thus suggest a change of the physical and optical properties of the snow. The estimated values of the curvature effect of the ice crystals and the interface kinetic coefficient are in good agreement with previously published values.},

   abstract = {The recovery of long-term climate proxy records with seasonal resolution is rare because of natural smoothing processes, discontinuities and limitations in measurement resolution. Yet insolation forcing, a primary driver of multimillennial-scale climate change, acts through seasonal variations with direct impacts on seasonal climate1. Whether the sensitivity of seasonal climate to insolation matches theoretical predictions has not been assessed over long timescales. Here, we analyse a continuous record of water-isotope ratios from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core to reveal summer and winter temperature changes through the last 11,000 years. Summer temperatures in West Antarctica increased through the early-to-mid-Holocene, reached a peak 4,100 years ago and then decreased to the present. Climate model simulations show that these variations primarily reflect changes in maximum summer insolation, confirming the general connection between seasonal insolation and warming and demonstrating the importance of insolation intensity rather than seasonally integrated insolation or season duration2,3. Winter temperatures varied less overall, consistent with predictions from insolation forcing, but also fluctuated in the early Holocene, probably owing to changes in meridional heat transport. The magnitudes of summer and winter temperature changes constrain the lowering of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet surface since the early Holocene to less than 162 m and probably less than 58 m, consistent with geological constraints elsewhere in West Antarctica4-7.},

Stable isotopes in the vapor phase move through the firn by diffusion along concentration gradients and by advection. Wind-driven ventilation carries atmospheric water vapor into the firn, where it mixes with existing pore-space vapor. Unlike previous models, our model allows disequilibrium between pore-space vapor and the surrounding snow grains. We also calculate the isotopic effects of ventilation-driven sublimation and condensation in the firn. Model predictions of isotopic diffusion in firn compare favorably with existing diffusion models. Model results quantify what other investigators have suggested: isotopic change in the upper few meters is more rapid than can be explained by the Whillans and Grootes (1985) model; isotopic equilibration with atmospheric vapor is an important component of post-depositional isotopic change; and ventilation enhances isotopic exchange by creating regions of relatively rapid sublimation and condensation in the firn.},

It is unlikely that the trend in the core from Taylor Mouth (the flank site) is due to a standard δ18O-surface temperature relationship. Assuming that the Taylor Dome (near-summit) core records local climate variations common to both cores, we assess two leading possible causes for the observed differences: (1) Relative to Taylor Dome, Taylor Mouth may collect snow from more sources with distinct isotopic compositions. (2) Vapor motion during prolonged near-surface exposure may cause post-depositional isotope enrichment at Taylor Mouth, where the accumulation rate is low. Our model of firn pore-space vapor and sublimating ice grains suggests that post-depositional processes can modify δ18O values by several ‰. Isotopic samples from areas with significantly different accumulation rates near Taylor Mouth could differentiate between possibilities (1) and (2).},

   abstract = {The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) will be losing mass at an accelerating pace throughout the 21st century, with a direct link between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the magnitude of Greenland mass loss. Currently, approximately 60% of the mass loss contribution comes from surface melt and subsequent meltwater runoff, while 40% are due to ice calving. In the ablation zone covered by bare ice in summer, most of the surface melt energy is provided by absorbed shortwave fluxes, which could be reduced by solar geoengineering measures. However, so far very little is known about the potential impacts of an artificial reduction in the incoming solar radiation on the GrIS surface energy budget and the subsequent change in meltwater production. By forcing the regional climate model MAR with the latest CMIP6 shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) future emission scenarios (SSP245, SSP585) and associated G6solar experiment from the CNRM-ESM2-1 Earth system model, we estimate the local impact of a reduced solar constant on the projected GrIS surface mass balance (SMB) decrease. Overall, our results show that even in the case of a low-mitigation greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP585), the Greenland surface mass loss can be brought in line with the medium-mitigation emissions scenario (SSP245) by reducing the solar downward flux at the top of the atmosphere by g1/440W/m2 or g1/41.5% (using the G6solar experiment). In addition to reducing global warming in line with SSP245, G6solar also decreases the efficiency of surface meltwater production over the Greenland ice sheet by damping the well-known positive melt-albedo feedback. With respect to a MAR simulation where the solar constant remains unchanged, decreasing the solar constant according to G6solar in the MAR radiative scheme mitigates the projected Greenland ice sheet surface melt increase by 6%. However, only more constraining geoengineering experiments than G6solar would allow us to maintain a positive SMB until the end of this century without any reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions.},

   abstract = {The oldest ice core records are obtained from the East Antarctic Plateau. Water isotopes are key proxies to reconstructing past climatic conditions over the ice sheet and at the evaporation source. The accuracy of climate reconstructions depends on knowledge of all processes affecting water vapour, precipitation and snow isotopic compositions. Fractionation processes are well understood and can be integrated in trajectory-based Rayleigh distillation and isotope-enabled climate models. However, a quantitative understanding of processes potentially altering snow isotopic composition after deposition is still missing. In low-accumulation sites, such as those found in East Antarctica, these poorly constrained processes are likely to play a significant role and limit the interpretability of an ice core's isotopic composition. By combining observations of isotopic composition in vapour, precipitation, surface snow and buried snow from Dome C, a deep ice core site on the East Antarctic Plateau, we found indications of a seasonal impact of metamorphism on the surface snow isotopic signal when compared to the initial precipitation. Particularly in summer, exchanges of water molecules between vapour and snow are driven by the diurnal sublimation-condensation cycles. Overall, we observe in between precipitation events modification of the surface snow isotopic composition. Using high-resolution water isotopic composition profiles from snow pits at five Antarctic sites with different accumulation rates, we identified common patterns which cannot be attributed to the seasonal variability of precipitation. These differences in the precipitation, surface snow and buried snow isotopic composition provide evidence of post-deposition processes affecting ice core records in low-accumulation areas.},

The response of the Greenland ice sheet to the warmer-than-present climate of the Eemian has thus remained unclear. Here we present the new North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling ('NEEM') ice core and show only a modest ice-sheet response to the strong warming in the early Eemian. We reconstructed the Eemian record from folded ice using globally homogeneous parameters known from dated Greenland and Antarctic ice-core records. On the basis of water stable isotopes, NEEM surface temperatures after the onset of the Eemian (126,000 years ago) peaked at 8 ± 4 degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium, followed by a gradual cooling that was probably driven by the decreasing summer insolation. Between 128,000 and 122,000 years ago, the thickness of the northwest Greenland ice sheet decreased by 400 ± 250 metres, reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of 130 ± 300 metres lower than the present. Extensive surface melt occurred at the NEEM site during the Eemian, a phenomenon witnessed when melt layers formed again at NEEM during the exceptional heat of July 2012. With additional warming, surface melt might become more common in the future. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Ice-core-based records of isotopic composition are a proxy for past temperatures and can thus provide information on polar climate variability over a large range of timescales. However, individual isotope records are affected by a multitude of processes that may mask the true temperature variability. The relative magnitude of climate and non-climate contributions is expected to vary as a function of timescale, and thus it is crucial to determine those temporal scales on which the actual signal dominates the noise. At present, there are no reliable estimates of this timescale dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we present a simple method that applies spectral analyses to stable-isotope data from multiple cores to estimate the SNR, and the signal and noise variability, as a function of timescale. The method builds on separating the contributions from a common signal and from local variations and includes a correction for the effects of diffusion and time uncertainty. We apply our approach to firn-core arrays from Dronning Maud Land (DML) in East Antarctica and from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). For DML and decadal to multi-centennial timescales, we find an increase in the SNR by nearly 1 order of magnitude ( ∼ 0.2 at decadal and ∼ 1.0 at multi-centennial scales). The estimated spectrum of climate variability also shows increasing variability towards longer timescales, contrary to what is traditionally inferred from single records in this region. In contrast, the inferred variability spectrum for WAIS stays close to constant over decadal to centennial timescales, and the results even suggest a decrease in SNR over this range of timescales. We speculate that these differences between DML and WAIS are related to differences in the spatial and temporal scales of the isotope signal, highlighting the potentially more homogeneous atmospheric conditions on the Antarctic Plateau in contrast to the marine-influenced conditions on WAIS. In general, our approach provides a methodological basis for separating local proxy variability from coherent climate variations, which is applicable to a large set of palaeoclimate records.},

   abstract = {Ice core water isotope records from Greenland and Antarctica are a valuable proxy for paleoclimate reconstruction, yet the processes influencing the climate signal stored in the isotopic composition of the snow are being challenged and revisited. Apart from precipitation input, post-depositional processes such as wind-driven redistribution and vapor-snow exchange processes at and below the surface are hypothesized to contribute to the isotope climate signal subsequently stored in the ice. Recent field studies have shown that surface snow isotopes vary between precipitation events and co-vary with vapor isotopes, which demonstrates that vapor-snow exchange is an important driving mechanism. Here we investigate how vapor-snow exchange processes influence the isotopic composition of the snowpack. Controlled laboratory experiments under forced sublimation show an increase in snow isotopic composition of up to 8‰ δ18 O in the uppermost layer due to sublimation, with an attenuated signal down to 3 cm snow depth over the course of 4-6 d. This enrichment is accompanied by a decrease in the second-order parameter d-excess, indicating kinetic fractionation processes. Our observations confirm that sublimation alone can lead to a strong enrichment of stable water isotopes in surface snow and subsequent enrichment in the layers below. To compare laboratory experiments with realistic polar conditions, we completed four 2-3 d field experiments at the East Greenland Ice Core Project site (northeast Greenland) in summer 2019. High-resolution temporal sampling of both natural and isolated snow was conducted under clear-sky conditions and demonstrated that the snow isotopic composition changes on hourly timescales. A change of snow isotope content associated with sublimation is currently not implemented in isotope-enabled climate models and is not taken into account when interpreting ice core isotopic records. However, our results demonstrate that postdepositional processes such as sublimation contribute to the climate signal recorded in the water isotopes in surface snow, in both laboratory and field settings. This suggests that the ice core water isotope signal may effectively integrate across multiple parameters, and the ice core climate record should be interpreted as such, particularly in regions of low accumulation.},

   abstract = {An “offline” approach to DA is used, where static ensemble samples are drawn from existing CMIP climate-model simulations to serve as the prior estimate of climate variables. We use linear, univariate forward models (“proxy system models (PSMs)") that map climate variables to proxy measurements by fitting proxy data to 2 m air temperature from gridded instrumental temperature data; the linear PSMs are then used to predict proxy values from the prior estimate. Results for the LMR are compared against six gridded instrumental temperature data sets and 25% of the proxy records are withheld from assimilation for independent verification. Results show broad agreement with previous reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere mean 2 m air temperature, with millennial-scale cooling, a multicentennial warm period around 1000 C.E., and a cold period coincident with the Little Ice Age (circa 1450-1800 C.E.). Verification against gridded instrumental data sets during 1880-2000 C.E. reveals greatest skill in the tropics and lowest skill over Northern Hemisphere land areas. Verification against independent proxy records indicates substantial improvement relative to the model (prior) data without proxy assimilation. As an illustrative example, we present multivariate reconstructed fields for a singular event, the 1808/1809 “mystery” volcanic eruption, which reveal global cooling that is strongly enhanced locally due to the presence of the Pacific-North America wave pattern in the 500 hPa geopotential height field.},

   abstract = {The presence of large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and reduced greenhouse gas concentrations during the Last Glacial Maximum fundamentally altered global ocean-atmosphere climate dynamics. Model simulations and palaeoclimate records suggest that glacial boundary conditions affected the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, a dominant source of short-term global climate variability. Yet little is known about changes in short-term climate variability at mid- to high latitudes. Here we use a high-resolution water isotope record from West Antarctica to demonstrate that interannual to decadal climate variability at high southern latitudes was almost twice as large at the Last Glacial Maximum as during the ensuing Holocene epoch (the past 11,700 years). Climate model simulations indicate that this increased variability reflects an increase in the teleconnection strength between the tropical Pacific and West Antarctica, owing to a shift in the mean location of tropical convection. This shift, in turn, can be attributed to the influence of topography and albedo of the North American ice sheets on atmospheric circulation. As the planet deglaciated, the largest and most abrupt decline in teleconnection strength occurred between approximately 16,000 years and 15,000 years ago, followed by a slower decline into the early Holocene.},

   abstract = {The incorporation of water isotopologues into the hydrology of general circulation models (GCMs) facilitates the comparison between modeled and measured proxy data in paleoclimate archives. However, the variability and drivers of measured and modeled water isotopologues, as well as the diversity of their representation in different models, are not well constrained. Improving our understanding of this variability in past and present climates will help to better constrain future climate change projections and decrease their range of uncertainty. Speleothems are a precisely datable terrestrial paleoclimate archives and provide well-preserved (semi-)continuous multivariate isotope time series in the lower latitudes and mid-latitudes and are therefore well suited to assess climate and isotope variability on decadal and longer timescales. However, the relationships of speleothem oxygen and carbon isotopes to climate variables are influenced by site-specific parameters, and their comparison to GCMs is not always straightforward. Here we compare speleothem oxygen and carbon isotopic signatures from the Speleothem Isotopes Synthesis and Analysis database version 2 (SISALv2) to the output of five different water-isotope-enabled GCMs (ECHAM5-wiso, GISS-E2-R, iCESM, iHadCM3, and isoGSM) over the last millennium (850-1850 CE). We systematically evaluate differences and commonalities between the standardized model simulation outputs. The goal is to distinguish climatic drivers of variability for modeled isotopes and compare them to those of measured isotopes. We find strong regional differences in the oxygen isotope signatures between models that can partly be attributed to differences in modeled surface temperature. At low latitudes, precipitation amount is the dominant driver for stable water isotope variability; however, at cave locations the agreement between modeled temperature variability is higher than for precipitation variability. While modeled isotopic signatures at cave locations exhibited extreme events coinciding with changes in volcanic and solar forcing, such fingerprints are not apparent in the speleothem isotopes. This may be attributed to the lower temporal resolution of speleothem records compared to the events that are to be detected. Using spectral analysis, we can show that all models underestimate decadal and longer variability compared to speleothems (albeit to varying extents). We found that no model excels in all analyzed comparisons, although some perform better than the others in either mean or variability. Therefore, we advise a multi-model approach whenever comparing proxy data to modeled data. Considering karst and cave internal processes, e.g., through isotope-enabled karst models, may alter the variability in speleothem isotopes and play an important role in determining the most appropriate model. By exploring new ways of analyzing the relationship between the oxygen and carbon isotopes, their variability, and co-variability across timescales, we provide methods that may serve as a baseline for future studies with different models using, e.g., different isotopes, different climate archives, or different time periods.},

These samples were analyzed for their isotope composition to understand the processes affecting the climatic signal archived in the water stable isotope records from the NEEM deep ice core. The dominant moisture source for the snow deposited at the NEEM-site may be originating as far south as 35N from the western part of the Atlantic Ocean. The surface atmospheric water vapor appears in isotopic equilibrium with the snow surface indicating a large water exchange between the atmosphere and snowpack. The interannual variability of NEEM shallow firn/ice cores stable isotope data covering the last ∼40 years shows an unexpectedly weak NAO signal. Regional to global atmospheric models simulate a dominant summer precipitation in the NEEM area, suggesting that the intermittency of modern winter precipitation is responsible for the lack of a strong NAO imprint. The interannual variability of NEEM isotope data however shows a strong correlation with interannual variations of Baffin Bay sea ice cover, a relationship consistent with air mass trajectories. NEEM deep ice core isotopic records may therefore provide detailed information on past Baffin Bay sea ice extent.

   abstract = {Key Points:  Atmosphere-snow exchange of water vapor is a key process for the signal formation of the snow isotopic composition  Taking into account isotopic fractionation during sublimation we explain a significant share of the observed day-today isotope variability  Atmosphere-snow exchange introduces a warm-bias in the net summer snow isotope signal that is not accounted for in ice core interpretations Abstract The climate signal imprinted in the snow isotopic composition allows to infer past climate variability from ice core stable water isotope records. The concurrent evolution of vapor and surface snow isotopic composition between precipitation events indicates that post-depositional atmosphere-snow humidity exchange influences the snow and hence the ice core isotope signal. To date, however, this is not accounted for in paeleoclimate reconstructions from isotope records. Here we show that vapor-snow exchange explains 36% of the summertime day-today  18 O variability of the surface snow between precipitation events, and 53% of the D variability. Through observations from the Greenland Ice Sheet and accompanying modeling we demonstrate that vapor-snow exchange introduces a warm bias on the summertime snow isotope value relevant for ice core records. In case of long-term variability in atmosphere-snow exchange the relevance for the ice core signal is also variable and thus paleoclimate reconstructions from isotope records should be revisited. Plain Language Summary Ice core water isotope records are valuable climate proxies containing information about past climate. Climate reconstructions from ice cores have been based on the interpretation of the water isotope records as precipitation signal. Here we show that the humidity exchange between atmosphere and snow influences the surface snow isotopic composition in-between precipitation events in summer. Thus, it is not the precipitation signal alone that defines the summer snow isotope signal but a combination of precipitation and post-depositional atmospheric vapor-snow exchange. This suggests, that climate reconstructions from ice core isotope records should account for post-depositional processes in the interpretation of the water isotope signal,},

The data were acquired visually using an optical dark-field line scanner. We detect and describe melt layers and lenses, seen as bubble-free layers and lenses, throughout the ice above the bubble-clathrate transition. This transition is located at 1150 m depth in the EastGRIP ice core, corresponding to an age of 9720 years b2k. We define the brittle zone in the EastGRIP ice core as that from 650 to 950 m depth, where we count on average more than three core breaks per meter. We analyze melt layer thicknesses, correct for ice thinning, and account for missing layers due to core breaks. Our record of melt events shows a large, distinct peak around 1014 years b2k (986 CE) and a broad peak around 7000 years b2k, corresponding to the Holocene Climatic Optimum. In total, we can identify approximately 831 mm of melt (corrected for thinning) over the past 10 000 years. We find that the melt event from 986 CE is most likely a large rain event similar to that from 2012 CE, and that these two events are unprecedented throughout the Holocene. We also compare the most recent 2500 years to a tree ring composite and find an overlap between melt events and tree ring anomalies indicating warm summers. Considering the ice dynamics of the EastGRIP site resulting from the flow of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), we find that summer temperatures must have been at least 3 ± 0.6 ° C warmer during the Early Holocene compared to today.},

   abstract = {In this study, a first set of four present-day global experiments with the ECHAM5 atmospheric general circulation model enhanced by stable water isotope diagnostics (ECHAM5-wiso) is presented. Model resolution varies from a typical coarse horizontal grid of 3.8° × 3.8° (T31) to a fine grid of 0.75° × 0.75° (T159). Vertical resolution varies from 19 to 31 model levels. On a global scale, the ECHAM5-wiso simulation results are in good agreement with available observations of the isotopic composition of precipitation from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), on an annual as well as a seasonal time scale. In many instances, the isotope simulation results clearly benefit from an increased horizontal and vertical model resolution. The exemplary relevance of this model resolution dependence is demonstrated for the simulation of the isotopic composition of Antarctic precipitation. Here, the simulation with the fine T159L31 model resolution not only yields a better agreement with observational data sets but also allows for a more realistic retuning of the supersaturation function leading to improved deuterium excess performance over the Antarctic continent, which is important for the interpretation of polar ice cores. Finally, the ECHAM5-wiso simulation results are compared to newly available measurements of the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor. Model and data agree well, with differences in the range of ±10‰ for near-surface atmospheric values at several GNIP stations. A comparison of the ECHAM5-wiso simulations with total column averaged HDO data from the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument on board the environmental satellite Envisat shows the same latitudinal gradients but an offset between 20‰ and 50‰ of unknown origin.
